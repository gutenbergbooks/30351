<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Then the big door swung back as if of itself. Marie
Louise had felt that she would scream if she were kept
a moment outside. The luxury of simply wishing the gate
ajar gave her a fairy-book delight enhanced by the pleasant
deference of the footman, whose face seemed to be hung on
the door like a Japanese mask.</p>
<p>Marie Louise rejoiced in the dull splendor of the hall.
The obsolete gorgeousness of the London home had never
been in good taste, but had grown as lovable with years as
do the gaudy frumperies of a rich old relative. All the good,
comfortable shelter of wealth won her blessing now as never
before. The stairway had something of the grand manner,
too, but it condescended graciously to escort her up to her
own room; and there, she knew, was a solitude where she
could cry as hard as she wanted to, and therefore usually did
not want to. Besides, her mood now was past crying for.</p>
<p>She was afraid of the world, afraid of the light. She felt
the cave-impulse to steal into a deep nook and cower there
till her heart should be replenished with courage automatically,
as ponds are fed from above.</p>
<p>Marie Louise wanted walls about her, and stillness, and
people shut out. She was in one of the moods when the
soul longs to gather its faculties together in a family, making
one self of all its selves. Marie Louise had known privation
and homelessness and the perils they bring a young woman,
and now she had riches and a father and mother who were
great people in a great land, and who had adopted her into
their own hearts, their lives, their name. But to-day she
asked nothing more than a deep cranny in a dark cave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>She would have said that no human voice or presence
could be anything but a torture to her. And yet, when
she hurried up the steps, she was suddenly miraculously
restored to cheerfulness by the tiny explosion of a child&rsquo;s
laughter instantly quenched. She knew that she was about
to be ambushed as usual. She must pretend to be completely
surprised once more, and altogether terrified with her
perfect regularity.</p>
<p>Her soul had been so utterly surprised and terrified in the
outer world that this infantile parody was curiously welcome,
since nothing keeps the mind in balance on the tight-rope of
sanity like the counterweight that comedy furnishes to
tragedy, farce to frenzy, and puerility to solemnity.</p>
<p>The children called her &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; but they were not hers
except through the adoption of a love that had to claim some
kinship. They looked like her children, though&ndash;&ndash;so much so,
indeed, that strangers thought that she was their young
mother. But it was because she looked like their mother,
who had died, that the American girl was a member of this
British household, inheriting some of its wealth and much
of its perilous destiny.</p>
<p>She had been ambuscaded in the street to-day by demons
not of faery, but of fact, that had leaped out at her from
nowhere. It solaced her somehow to burlesque the terror
that had whelmed her, and, now that she was assailed by
ruthless thugs of five and seven years, the shrieks she had
not dared to release in the street she gave forth with vigor,
as two nightgowned tots flung themselves at her with milk-curdling
cries of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo-ooh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding up pink fat hands for pistols, they snapped their
thumbs at her and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang! Bang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she emitted most amusing squeals of anguish and
staggered back, stammering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, p-p-please, Mr. Robbobber and Miss Burgurgular,
take my l-l-life but spare my m-m-money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been so genuinely scared before that she marred
the sacred text now, and the First Murderer, who had all
the conservative instincts of childhood, had to correct her
misquotation of the sacred formula:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Auntie. Say, &lsquo;Take my money but spare my life!&rsquo;
Now we dot to do it all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon humbly,&rdquo; she said, and went back to
be ambushed again. This time the boy had an inspiration.
To murder and robbery he would add scalping.</p>
<p>But Marie Louise was tired. She had had enough of
fright, real or feigned, and refused to be scalped. Besides,
she had been to the hairdresser&rsquo;s, and she explained that
she really could not afford to be scalped. The boy was bitterly
disappointed, and he grew furious when the untimely
maid came for him and for his ruthless sister and demanded
that they come to bed at once or be reported.</p>
<p>As the warriors were dragged off to shameful captivity,
Marie Louise, watching them, was suddenly shocked by
the thought of how early in life humanity begins to revel
in slaughter. The most innocent babes must be taught not
to torture animals. Cruelty comes with them like a caul,
or a habit brought in from a previous existence. They always
almost murder their mothers and sometimes quite slay them
when they are born. Their first pastimes are killing games,
playing dead, stories of witches, cannibalistic ogres. The
American Indian is the international nursery pet because of
his traditional fiendishness.</p>
<p>It seemed inconsistent, but it was historically natural
that the boy interrupted in his massacre of his beloved aunt
should hang back to squall that he would say his prayers
only to her. Marie Louise glanced at her watch. She had
barely time to dress for dinner, but the children had to be
obeyed. She made one weak protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fr&auml;ulein hears your prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s wented out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll hear them, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot to tell us fairy-&rsquo;tory, too,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, one fairy-&rsquo;tory&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to the nursery, and the cherubs swarmed up to
her lap demanding &ldquo;somefin bluggy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Invention failed her completely. She hunted through her
memory among the Grimms&rsquo; fairy-tales. She could recall
nothing that seemed sweet and guileless enough for these
two lambs.</p>
<p>All that she could think of seemed to be made up of ghoulish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
plots; of children being mistreated by harsh stepmothers;
of their being turned over to peasants to slay; of their being
changed into animals or birds; of their being seized by wolves,
or by giants that drank blood and crunched children&rsquo;s bones
as if they were reed birds; of hags that cut them up into bits
or thrust them into ovens and cooked them for gingerbread.
It occurred to her that all the German fairy-stories were
murderously cruel. She felt a revulsion against each of the
legends. But her mind could not find substitutes.</p>
<p>After a period of that fearful ordeal when children tyrannize
for romances that will not come, her mind grew mutinous
and balked. She confessed her poverty of ideas.</p>
<p>The girl, Bettina, sulked; the boy screamed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, botheration! We might as well say our prayers and
go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the least pious of moods they dropped from her knees
to their own and put their clasped hands across her lap.
They became in a way hallowed by their attitude, and the
world seemed good to her again as she looked down at the
two children, beautiful as only children can be, innocent
of wile, of hardship and of crime, safe at home and praying
to their heavenly Father from whose presence they had
so recently come.</p>
<p>But as she brooded over them motherly and took strength
from them as mothers do, she thought of other children in
other countries orphaned in swarms, starving in multitudes,
waiting for food like flocks of lambs in the blizzard
of the war. She thought still more vividly of children flung
into the ocean. She had seen these children at her knees
fighting against bitter medicines, choking on them and
blurting them out at mouth and nose and almost, it seemed,
at eyes. So it was very vivid to her how children thrown
into the sea must have gagged with terror at the bitter medicine
of death, strangled and smothered as they drowned.</p>
<p>She heard the prayers mumbled through, but at the hasty
&ldquo;Amen&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t thank God for anything. Haven&rsquo;t you anything
to thank God for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If they had expressed any doubt, she would have told them
of dozens of special mercies, but almost instantly they answered,
&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; They looked at each other, understood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
nodded, clapped their hands, and chuckled with pride. Then
they bent their heads, gabled their finger-tips, and the boy said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We t&rsquo;ank Dee, O Dod, for making sink dat old <i>Lusitania</i>.&rdquo;
And the girl said, &ldquo;A-men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise gave a start as if she had been stabbed.
It was the loss of the <i>Lusitania</i> that had first terrified her.
She had just seen it announced on the placards of newsboys
in London streets, and had fled home to escape from
the vision, only to hear the children thank Heaven for it!
She rose so suddenly that she flung the children back from
their knees to their haunches. They stared up at her in
wondering fear. She stepped outside the baleful circle and
went striding up and down the room, fighting herself back to
self-control, telling herself that the children were not to
blame, yet finding them the more repulsive for their very
innocence. The purer the lips, the viler the blasphemy.</p>
<p>She was not able to restrain herself from denouncing them
with all her ferocity. She towered over them and cried
out upon them: &ldquo;You wicked, wicked little beasts, how dare
you put such loathsome words into a prayer! God must have
gasped with horror in heaven at the shame of it. Wherever
did you get so hateful an idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked your own self!&rdquo; the boy snapped back. &ldquo;Fr&auml;ulein
read it in the paper about the old boat, and she walked
up and down the room like what you do, and she said, &lsquo;<i>Ach,
unser</i> Dott&ndash;&ndash;how dood you are to us, to make sink dat
<i>Lusitania</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going on to describe her ecstasy, but Marie Louise
broke in: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Fr&auml;ulein&rsquo;s work, is it? I might have known
that! Oh, the fiend, the harpy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did not know what a harpy was, but he knew
that his beloved Fr&auml;ulein was being called something, and
he struck at Marie Louise fiercely, kicked at her shins and
tried to bite her hands, screaming: &ldquo;You shall not call our
own precious Fr&auml;ulein names. Harpy, your own self!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the little girl struck and scratched and made a curdled
face and echoed, &ldquo;Harpy, your own self!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It hurt Marie Louise so extravagantly to be hated by
these irascible cherubs that her anger vanished in regret.
She pleaded: &ldquo;But, my darlings, you don&rsquo;t know what you
are saying. The <i>Lusitania</i> was a beautiful ship&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>The boy, Victor, was loyal always to his own: &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t
as beautiful as my yacht what I sail in the Round Pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise condescended to argue: &ldquo;Oh yes, she was!
She was a great ship, noble like Saint Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and
she was loaded with passengers, men and women and children:
and then suddenly she was ripped open and sunk, and little
children like you were thrown into the water, into the deep,
deep, deep ocean. And the big waves tore them from their
mothers&rsquo; arms and ran off with them, choking and strangling
them and dragging them down and down&ndash;&ndash;forever down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was dizzied by the horde of visions mobbing her brain.
Then the onrush of horror was checked abruptly as she saw
the supercilious lad regarding her frenzy calmly. His comment
was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It served &rsquo;em jolly well right for bein&rsquo; on &rsquo;at old boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise almost swooned with dread of such a soul.
She shrank from the boy and groaned, &ldquo;Oh, you toad, you
little toad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was frightened a little by her disgust, and he took
refuge in a higher authority. &ldquo;Fr&auml;ulein told us. And she
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bit lassiky stormed to his support: &ldquo;She does so!&rdquo; and
drove it home with the last nail of feminine argument: &ldquo;So
there now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise retorted, weakly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see! We&rsquo;ll soon
see!&rdquo; And she rushed out of the room, like another little
girl, straight to the door of Sir Joseph, where she knocked impatiently.
His man appeared and murmured through a
crevice: &ldquo;Sorry, miss, but Seh Joseph is dressing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise went to Lady Webling&rsquo;s door, and a maid
came to whisper: &ldquo;She is in her teb. We&rsquo;re having dinner
at tome to-night, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise nodded. Dinner must be served, and on
time. It was the one remaining solemnity that must not
be forgotten or delayed.</p>
<p>She went to her own room. Her maid was in a stew
about the hour, and the gown that was to be put on. Marie
Louise felt that black was the only wear on such a Bartholomew&rsquo;s
night. But Sir Joseph hated black so well that he
had put a clause in his will against its appearance even at
his own funeral. Marie Louise loved him dearly, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
feared his prejudices. She had an abject terror of offending
him, because she felt that she owed everything she had, and
was, to the whim of his good grace. Gratitude was a passion
with her, and it doomed her, as all passions do, good or bad,
to the penalties human beings pay for every excess of virtue
or vice&ndash;&ndash;if, indeed, vice is anything but an immoderate,
untimely virtue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>Marie Louise let her maid select the gown. She
was an exquisite picture as she stood before the long
mirror and watched the buckling on of her armor, her armor
of taffeta and velvet with the colors of sunlit leaves and noon-warmed
flowers in carefully elected wrinkles assured with
many a hook and eye. Her image was radiant and pliant
and altogether love-worthy, but her thoughts were sad and
stern.</p>
<p>She was resolved that Fr&auml;ulein should not remain in the
house another night. She wondered that Sir Joseph had
not ousted her from the family at the first crash of war.
The old crone! She could have posed for one of the Grimms&rsquo;
most vulturine witches. But she had kept a civil tongue in
her head till now; the children adored her, and Sir Joseph
had influence enough to save her from being interned or
deported.</p>
<p>Hitherto, Marie Louise had felt sorry for her in her dilemma
of being forced to live at peace in the country her own country
was locked in war with. Now she saw that the woman&rsquo;s
oily diplomacy was only for public use, and that all the while
she was imbruing the minds of the little children with the dye
of her own thoughts. The innocents naturally accepted
everything she told them as the essence of truth.</p>
<p>Marie Louise hoped to settle the affair before dinner, but
by the time she was gowned and primped, the first premature
guest had arrived like the rashest primrose, shy,
surprised, and surprising. Sir Joseph had gone below already.
Lady Webling was hull down on the stairway.</p>
<p>Marie Louise saw that her protest must wait till after the
dinner, and she followed to do her duty to the laws of
hospitality.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph liked to give these great affairs. He loved to
eat and to see others eat. &ldquo;The more the merrier,&rdquo; was his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
motto&ndash;&ndash;one of the most truthless of the old saws. Little
dinners at Sir Joseph&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;what he called &ldquo;on fameals&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;would
have been big dinners elsewhere. A big dinner was
like a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s banquet. He needed only a crier at his
back and a Petronius to immortalize his <i>gourmandise</i>.</p>
<p>To-night he had great folk and small fry. Nobody pretended
to know the names of everybody. Sir Joseph himself
leaned heavily on the man who sang out the labels of the
guests, and even then his wife whispered them to him as they
came forward, and for a precaution, kept slipping them into
the conversation as reminders.</p>
<p>There were several Americans present: a Doctor and Mrs.
Clinton Worthing who had come over with a special shipload
of nurses. The ship had been fitted out by Mrs. Worthing,
who had been Muriel Schuyler, daughter of the giant plutocrat,
Jacob Schuyler, who was lending England millions of money
weekly. A little American millionaire, Willie Enslee, living
in England now on account of some scandal in his past, was
there. He did not look romantic.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had no genius for names, or faces, either.
To-night she was frightened, and she made some horrible
blunders, greeting the grisly Mr. Verrinder by the name
of Mr. Hilary. The association was clear, for Mr. Hilary
had called Mr. Verrinder atrocious names in Parliament;
but it was like calling &ldquo;Mr. Capulet&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Montague.&rdquo; Marie
Louise tried to redeem her blunder by putting on an extra
effusiveness for the sake of Mr. and Mrs. Norcross. Mrs.
Norcross had only recently shaken off the name of Mrs.
Patchett after a resounding divorce. So Marie Louise called
her new husband by the name of her old, which made it very
pleasant.</p>
<p>Her wits were so badly dispersed that she gave up the
attempt to take in the name of an American whom Lady
Webling passed along to her as &ldquo;Mr. Davidge, of the States.&rdquo;
And he must have been somebody of importance, for even
Sir Joseph got his name right. Marie Louise, however, disliked
him cordially at once&ndash;&ndash;for two reasons: first, she hated
herself so much that she could not like anybody just then;
next, this American was entirely too American. He was awkward
and indifferent, but not at all with the easy amble
and patrician unconcern of an English aristocrat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>Marie Louise was American-born herself, and humbly
born, at that, but she liked extreme Americanism never the
more. Perhaps she was a bit of a snob, though fate was getting
ready to beat the snobbery out of her. And hers was
an unintentional, superficial snobbery, at worst. Some
people said she was affected and that she aped the swagger
dialect. But she had a habit of taking on the accent and
color of her environments. She had not been in England a
month before she spoke Piccadilly almost impeccably. She
had caught French and German intonations with equal speed
and had picked up music by ear with the same amazing
facility in the days when certain kinds of music were her
livelihood.</p>
<p>In one respect her Englishness of accent was less an imitation
or an affectation than a certain form of politeness and
modesty. When an Englishwoman said, &ldquo;Cahn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; it
seemed tactless to answer, &ldquo;No, I cann&rsquo;t.&rdquo; To respond to
&ldquo;Good mawning&rdquo; with &ldquo;Good morrning&rdquo; had the effect of
a contradiction or a correction. She had none of the shibboleth
spirit that leads certain people to die or slay for a
pronunciation. The pronunciation of the people she was
talking to was good enough for her. She conformed also
because she hated to see people listening less to what she said
than to the Yankee way she said it.</p>
<p>This man Davidge had a superb brow and a look of success,
but he bored her before he reached her. She made ready
for flight to some other group. Then he startled her&ndash;&ndash;by
being startled as he caught sight of her. When Lady Webling
transmitted him with a murmur of his name and a tender,
&ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; Davidge stopped short and mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of meeting you before, somewhere,
haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise snubbed him flatly. &ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the slap with a smile. &ldquo;Did I hear Lady Webling
call you her daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise did not explain, but answered, curtly, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
with the aristocratic English parsimony that makes it almost
&ldquo;Yis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re right and I&rsquo;m wrong. I beg your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daon&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said Marie Louise, and drew closer
to Lady Webling and the oncoming guest. She had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
decency to reproach herself for being beastly to the stranger,
but his name slipped at once through the sieve of her
memory.</p>
<p>Destiny is the grandiose title we give to the grand total
of a long column of accidents when we stop to tot up the
figures. So we wait till that strange sum of accidents which
we call a baby is added up into a living child of determined
sex before we fasten a name that changes an it to a him or a
her.</p>
<p>The accidents that result in a love-affair, too, we look back
on and outline into a definite road, and we call that Fate.
We are great for giving names to selected fragments of the
chaos of life.</p>
<p>In after years Marie Louise and this man Davidge would
see something mystic and intended in the meeting that was
to be the detached prologue of their after conflicts. They
would quite misremember what really happened&ndash;&ndash;which was,
that she retained no impression of him at all, and that he
called himself a fool for mixing her with a girl he had met years
and years before for just a moment, and had never forgotten
because he had not known her well enough to forget her.</p>
<p>He had reason enough to distrust his sanity for staring at
a resplendent creature in a London drawing-room and imagining
for a moment that she was a long-lost, long-sought girl
of old dreams&ndash;&ndash;a girl he had seen in a cheap vaudeville
theater in a Western state. She was one of a musical team
that played all sorts of instruments&ndash;&ndash;xylophones, saxophones,
trombones, accordions, cornets, comical instruments concealed
in hats and umbrellas. This girl had played each of
them in turn, in solo or with the rest of the group. The
other mummers were coarse and vaude-vulgar, but she had
captivated Davidge with her wild beauty, her magnetism,
and the strange cry she put into her music.</p>
<p>When she played the trombone she looked to him like
one of the angels on a cathedral trumpeting an apocalyptic
summons to the dead to bloom from their graves. When
she played the cornet it was with a superhuman tone that
shook his emotions almost insufferably. She had sung, too,
in four voices&ndash;&ndash;in an imitation of a bass, a tenor, a contralto,
and finally as a lyric soprano, then skipping from one to the
other. They called her &ldquo;Mamise, the Quartet in One.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>Davidge had thought her marvelous and had asked the
manager of the theater to introduce him. The manager
thought him a young fool, and Davidge had felt himself
one when he went back to the dingy stage, where he found
Mamise among a troupe of trained animals waiting to go on.
She was teasing a chittering, cigar-smoking trained ape on a
bicycle, and she proved to be an extraordinarily ordinary,
painfully plebeian girl, common in voice and diction, awkward
and rather contemptuous of the stage-door Johnnie. Davidge
had never ceased to blush, and blushed again now, when he
recalled his labored compliment, &ldquo;I expect to see your name
in the electric lights some of these days&ndash;&ndash;or nights, Miss
Mamise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had grumbled, &ldquo;Much ubbliged!&rdquo; and returned to the
ape, while Davidge slunk away, ashamed.</p>
<p>He had not forgotten that name, though the public had.
He had never seen &ldquo;Mamise&rdquo; in the electric lights. He
had never found the name in any dictionary. He had supposed
her to be a foreigner&ndash;&ndash;Spanish, Polish, Czech, French,
or something. He had not been able to judge her nationality
from the two gruff words, but he had often wondered
what had happened to her. She might have been killed in a
train wreck or been married to the ape-trainer or gone to
some other horrible conclusion. He had pretty well buried
her among his forgotten admirations and torments, when
lo and behold! she emerged from a crowd of peeresses and
plutocrats in London.</p>
<p>He had sprung toward her with a wild look of recognition
before he had had time to think it over. He had been rebuffed
by a cold glance and then by an English intonation
and a fashionable phrase. He decided that his memory
had made a fool of him, and he stood off, humble and confused.</p>
<p>But his eyes quarreled with his ears, and kept telling
him that this tall beauty who ignored him so perfectly, so
haughtily, was really his lost Mamise.</p>
<p>If men would trust their intuitions oftener they would
not go wrong so often, perhaps, since their best reasoning
is only guesswork, after all. It was not going to be destiny
that brought Davidge and Marie Louise together again so
much as the man&rsquo;s hatred of leaving anything unfinished&ndash;&ndash;even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
a dream or a vague desire. There was no shaking
Davidge off a thing he determined on except as you shake off
a snapping-turtle, by severing its body from its head.</p>
<p>A little later Sir Joseph sought the man out and treated
him respectfully, and Marie Louise knew he must be somebody.
She found him staring at her over Sir Joseph&rsquo;s shoulder
and puzzling about her. And this made her wretchedly uncomfortable,
for perhaps, after all, she fretted, he had indeed
met her somewhere before, somewhere in one of those odious
strata she had passed through on her way up to the estate of
being called daughter by Lady Webling.</p>
<p>She forgot her misgivings and was restored to equanimity
by the incursion of Polly Widdicombe and her husband.
Polly was one of the best-dressed women in the world. Her
husband had the look of the husband of the best-dressed
woman in the world. Polly had a wiry voice, and made no
effort to soften it, but she was tremendously smart. She
giggled all the time and set people off in her vicinity, though
her talk was rarely witty on its own account.</p>
<p>Laughter rippled all through her life. She talked of her
griefs in a plucky, riant way, making eternal fun of herself
as a giddy fool. She carried a delightful jocundity wherever
she went. She was aristocratic, too, in the postgraduate degree
of being careless, reckless, superior even to good manners.
She had a good heart and amiable feelings; these made
manners enough.</p>
<p>She had lineage as well, for her all-American family ran
straight back into the sixteen hundreds, which was farther
than many a duke dared trace his line. She had traveled the
world; she had danced with kings, and had made two popes
laugh and tweak her pointed chin. She wasn&rsquo;t afraid of
anybody, not even of peasants and servants, or of being
friendly with them, or angry with them.</p>
<p>Marie Louise adored her. She felt that it would make no
difference to Polly&rsquo;s affection if she found out all there was to
find out about Marie Louise. And yet Polly&rsquo;s friendship
did not have the dull certainty of indestructibility. Marie
Louise knew that one word wrong or one act out of key might
end it forever, and then Polly would be her loud and ardent
enemy, and laugh at her instead of for her. Polly could
hate as briskly as she could love.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>She was in one of her vitriolic moods now because of the
<i>Lusitania</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have come to-night,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;except that
I want to talk to a lot of people about Germany. I want to
tell everybody I know how much I loathe &rsquo;em all. &lsquo;The
Hymn of Hate&rsquo; is a lullaby to what I feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly was also conducting a glorious war with Lady Clifton-Wyatt.
Lady C.-W. had bullied everybody in London so
successfully that she went straight up against Polly Widdicombe
without a tremor. She got what-for, and everybody
was delighted. The two were devoted enemies from then on,
and it was beautiful to see them come together.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt followed Polly up the receiving line to-night
and invited a duel, but Polly was in no humor for a
fight with anybody but Germans. She turned her full-orbed
back on Lady C.-W. and, so to speak, gnashed her shoulder-blades
at her. Lady C.-W. passed by without a word, and
Marie Louise was glad to hide behind Polly, for Marie Louise
was mortally afraid of Lady C.-W.</p>
<p>She saw the American greet her as if he had met her before.
Lady Clifton-Wyatt was positively polite to him. He must
be a very great man.</p>
<p>She heard Lady Clifton-Wyatt say something about, &ldquo;How
is the new ship coming on?&rdquo; and the American said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
doing as well as could be expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he was a ship-builder. Marie Louise thought that his
must be a heartbreaking business in these days when ships
were being slaughtered in such numbers. She asked Polly
and her husband if they knew him or his name.</p>
<p>Widdicombe shook his head. Polly laughed at her husband.
&ldquo;How do you know? He might be your own mother, for all
you can tell. Put on your distance-glasses, you poor fish.&rdquo;
She turned to Marie Louise. &ldquo;You know how near-sighted
Tom is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent fault in a man,&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t trust even
the blind ones. And you&rsquo;ll notice that when Tom comes to
one of these d&eacute;collet&eacute; dinners, he wears his reading-glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Widdicombe was taking out his distance-glasses,
taking off his reading-glasses and pouching them and
putting them away, and putting on his distance-glasses, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
from force of habit putting their pouch away. Then he stared
at Davidge, took off his distance-glasses, found the case with
difficulty, put them up, pocketed them, and stood blearing
into space while he searched for his reading-glasses, found
them, put the case back in his pocket and saddled his nose
with the lenses.</p>
<p>Polly waited in a mockery of patience and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after all that, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; said Widdicombe.</p>
<p>It was a good deal of an anticlimax to so much work.</p>
<p>Polly said: &ldquo;That proves nothing. Tom&rsquo;s got a near-memory,
too. The man&rsquo;s a pest. If he didn&rsquo;t make so much
money, I&rsquo;d abandon him on a door-step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Polly&rsquo;s form of baby-talk. Everybody knew how
she doted on Tom: she called him names as one scolds a pet
dog. Widdicombe had the helpless manner of one, and was
always at heel with Polly. But he was a Titan financially,
and he was signing his name now to munitions-contracts as
big as national debts.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was summoned from the presence of the
Widdicombes by one of Lady Webling&rsquo;s most mysterious
glances, to meet a new-comer whom Lady Webling evidently
regarded as a special treasure. Lady Webling was as wide as
a screen, and she could always form a sort of alcove in front
of her by turning her back on the company. She made such
a nook now and, taking Marie Louise&rsquo;s hand in hers, put it
in the hand of the tall and staring man whose very look
Marie Louise found invasive. His handclasp was somehow
like an illicit caress.</p>
<p>How strange it is that with so much modesty going about,
people should be allowed to wear their hands naked! The
fashion of the last few years compelling the leaving off of
gloves was not really very nice. Marie Louise realized it for
the first time. Her fastidious right hand tried to escape
from the embrace of the stranger&rsquo;s fingers, but they clung
devil-fishily, and Lady Webling&rsquo;s soft cushion palm was there
conniving in the abduction. And her voice had a wheedling
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my dear Nicky I have spoken of so much&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Easton, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Be very nice to him,&rdquo; said Lady Webling. &ldquo;He is taking
you out to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the butler appeared, solemn as a long-awaited
priest, and there was such a slow crystallization as
follows a cry of &ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo; to weary soldiers. The guests
were soon in double file and on the march to the battlefield
with the cooks.</p>
<p>Nicky Easton still had Marie Louise&rsquo;s hand; he had carried
it up into the crook of his right arm and kept his left hand
over it for guard. A lady can hardly wrench loose from such
an attention, but Marie Louise abhorred it.</p>
<p>Nicky treated her as a sort of possession, and she resented
his courtesies. He began too soon with compliments. One
hates to have even a bunch of violets jabbed into one&rsquo;s nose
with the command, &ldquo;Smell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disliked his accent, too. There was a Germanic something
in it as faint as the odor of high game. It was a time
when the least hint of Teutonism carried the stench of death
to British nostrils.</p>
<p>Lady Webling and Sir Joseph were known to be of German
birth, and their phrases carried the tang, but Sir Joseph
had become a naturalized citizen ages ago and had won
respect and affection a decade back. His lavish use of his
money for charities and for great industries had won him his
knighthood, and while there was a certain sniff of suspicion
in certain fanatic quarters at the mention of his name, those
who knew him well had so long ago forgotten his alien birth
that they forgave it him now.</p>
<p>As for Marie Louise, she no longer heeded the Prussic acid
of his speech. She was as used to it as to his other little
mannerisms. She did not think of the old couple as fat and
awkward. She did not analyze their attributes or think of
their features in detail. She thought of them simply as them.
But Easton was new; he brought in a subtle whiff of the hated
Germany that had done the <i>Lusitania</i> to death.</p>
<p>The fate of the ship made the dinner resemble a solemn
wake. The triumphs of the chef were but funeral baked meats.
The feast was brilliant and large and long, and it seemed
criminal to see such waste of provender when so much of the
world was hungry. The talk was almost all of the <i>Lusitania</i>
and the deep damnation of her taking off. Many of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
guests had crossed the sea in her graceful shell, and they
felt a personal loss as well as a bitterness of rage at the worst
of the German sea crimes.</p>
<p>Davidge was seated remotely from Marie Louise, far down
the flowery lane of the table. She could not see him at all,
for the candles and the roses. Just once she heard his voice
in a lull. Its twang carried it all the way up the alley:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man that would kill a passenger-ship would shoot a
baby in its cradle. When you think how long it takes to
build a ship, how much work she represents, how sweet she
is when she rides out and all that&ndash;&ndash;by Gosh! there&rsquo;s no
word mean enough for the skoundrels. There&rsquo;s nothing
they won&rsquo;t do now&ndash;&ndash;absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard no more of him, and she did not see him again
that night. She forgot him utterly. Even the little wince
of distress he gave her by his provincialism was forgotten in
the anguish her foster-parents caused her.</p>
<p>For Marie Louise had a strange, an odious sensation that
Sir Joseph and Lady Webling were not quite sincere in their
expressions of horror and grief over the finished epic, the
<i>Lusitania</i>. It was not for lack of language; they used the
strongest words they could find. But there was missing the
subtile somewhat of intonation and gesture that actors call
sincerity. Marie Louise knew how hard it is even for a
great actor to express his simplest thoughts with conviction.
No, it was when he expressed them best that he was least
convincing, since an emotion that can be adequately presented
is not a very big emotion; at least it does not overwhelm the
soul. Inadequacy, helplessness, gaucherie, prove that the
feelings are bigger than the eloquence. They &ldquo;get across the
footlights&rdquo; between each player on the human stage and his
audience.</p>
<p>Yes, that was it: Sir Joseph and Lady Webling were protesting
too well and too much. Marie Louise hated herself
for even the disloyalty of such a criticism of them, but she
was repelled somehow by such rhetoric, and she liked far
better the dour silence of old Mr. Verrinder. He looked
a bishop who had got into a layman&rsquo;s evening dress by mistake.
He was something very impressive and influential in
the government, nobody knew just what.</p>
<p>Marie Louise liked still better than Verrinder&rsquo;s silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the distracted muttering and stammering of a young English
aviator, the Marquess of Strathdene, who was recuperating
from wounds and was going up in the air rapidly on the
Webling champagne. He was maltreating his bread and
throwing in champagne with an apparent eagerness for the
inevitable result. Before he grew quite too thick to be
understood, he groaned to himself, but loudly enough to
be heard the whole length and breadth of the table: &ldquo;I
remember readin&rsquo; about old Greek witch name Circe&ndash;&ndash;changed
human beings into shape of swine. I wonder
who turned those German swine into the shape of human
beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise noted that Lady Webling was shocked&ndash;&ndash;by
the vulgarity, no doubt. &ldquo;Swine&rdquo; do not belong in dining-room
language&ndash;&ndash;only in the platters or the chairs. Marie
Louise caught an angry look also in the eye of Nicholas Easton,
though he, too, had been incisive in his comments on the theme
of the dinner. His English had been uncannily correct,
his phrases formal with the exactitude of a book on syntax
or the dialogue of a gentleman in a novel. But he also was
drinking too much, and as his lips fuddled he had trouble
with a very formal &ldquo;without which.&rdquo; It resulted first as
&ldquo;veetowit veech,&rdquo; then as &ldquo;whidthout witch.&rdquo; He made it
on the third trial.</p>
<p>Marie Louise, turning her eyes his way in wonder, encountered
two other glances moving in the same direction. Lady
Webling looked anxious, alarmed. Mr. Verrinder&rsquo;s gaze was
merely studious. Marie Louise felt an odd impression that
Lady Webling was sending a kind of heliographic warning,
while the look of Mr. Verrinder was like a search-light that
studies and registers, then moves away.</p>
<p>Marie Louise disliked Easton more and more, but Lady
Webling kept recommending him with her solicitous manner
toward him. She made several efforts, too, to shift the
conversation from the <i>Lusitania</i>; but it swung always back.
Much bewilderment was expressed because the ship was
not protected by a convoy. Many wondered why she was
where she was when she was struck, and how she came to take
that course at all.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt, who had several friends on board and
was uncertain of their fate, was unusually fierce in blaming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
the government. She always blamed it for everything, when
it was Liberal. And now she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing short of murder to have left the poor ship
to steal in by herself without protection. Whatever was the
Admiralty thinking of? If the Cabinet doesn&rsquo;t fall for this,
we might as well give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Liberals present acknowledged her notorious prejudices
with a sigh of resignation. But the Marquess of
Strathdene rolled a foggy eye and a foggy tongue in
answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darlling llady, there must have been war-ships waitin&rsquo;
to convoy the <i>Lusitania</i>; but she didn&rsquo;t come to rendezvous
because why? Because some filthy Zherman gave her a
false wireless and led her into a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This amazing theory with its drunken inspiration of plausibility
startled the whole throng. It set eyeballs rolling in
all directions like a break in a game of pool. Everybody stared
at Strathdene, then at somebody else. Marie Louise&rsquo;s racing
gaze noted that Mr. Verrinder&rsquo;s eyes went slowly about again,
studying everybody except Strathdene.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s eyes as they ran simply expressed a
disgust that she put into words with her usual frankness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be more idiotic than necess&rsquo;ry, my dear boy; there
are secret codes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-secret codes I know? Secret codes the Germans know&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
what you mean, sweetheart. I don&rsquo;t know one little
secret, but Huns&ndash;&ndash; Do you know how many thousand
Germans there are loose in England&ndash;&ndash;do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt shook her head impatiently. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t the faintest notion. Far more than I wish, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, unless you wish fifty thousand. And God
knows how many more. And I&rsquo;m not alluthing to Germans in
disguise, naturalized Germans&ndash;&ndash;quinine pills with a little coating.
I&rsquo;m not referring to you, of course, Sir Joseph. Greates&rsquo;
respect for you. Ever&rsquo;body has. You have done all you
could to overcome the fatal error of your parents. You&rsquo;re a
splen&rsquo;id gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man. Your &rsquo;xception proves rule. Even Germans
can&rsquo;t all be perf&rsquo;ly rotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Marquess, thank you,&rdquo; said Sir Joseph, with
a natural embarrassment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>Marie Louise noted the slight difference between the
English &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; and Sir Joseph&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thang gyou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Lady Webling&rsquo;s eyes went around the table, catching
up the women&rsquo;s eyes and forms, and she led them in a troop
from the embarrassing scene. She brought the embarrassment
with her to the drawing-room, where the women sat
about smoking miserably and waiting for the men to come
forth and take them home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>There must have been embarrassment enough left to
go round the dining-table, too, for in an unusually brief
while the men flocked into the drawing-room. And they
began to plead engagements in offices or homes or Parliament.</p>
<p>It was not yet ten o&rsquo;clock when the last of the guests had
gone, except Nicholas Easton. And Sir Joseph took him into
his own study. Easton walked a trifle too solemnly straight,
as if he had set himself an imaginary chalk-line to follow.
He jostled against the door, and as he closed it, swung with
it uncertainly.</p>
<p>Lady Webling asked almost at once, with a nod of the
head in the direction of the study door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear child, what do you think of Nicky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s nice, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very fond of him, Sir Joseph and I&ndash;&ndash;and we do hope
you will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise wondered if they were going to select a husband
for her. It was a dreadful situation, because there was
no compulsion except the compulsion of obligation. They
never gave her a chance to do anything for them; they were
always doing things for her. What an ingrate she would
be to rebuff their first real desire! And yet to marry a man
she felt such antipathy for&ndash;&ndash;surely there could be some less
hateful way of obliging her benefactors. She felt like a castaway
on a desert, and there was something of the wilderness
in the immensity of the drawing-room with its crowds of
untenanted divans and of empty chairs drawn into groups
as the departed guests had left them.</p>
<p>Lady Webling stood close to Marie Louise and pressed
for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really dislike Nicky, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-o-o. I&rsquo;ve not known him long enough to dislike him
very well.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>She tried to soften the rebuff with a laugh, but Lady
Webling sighed profoundly and smothered her disappointment
in a fond &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; She smothered the great child, too,
in a hugely buxom embrace. When Marie emerged she was
suddenly reminded that she had not yet spoken to Lady
Webling of Fr&auml;ulein Ernst&rsquo;s attack on the children&rsquo;s souls.
She spoke now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing, mamma, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you
all evening. Please don&rsquo;t let it distress you, but really I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ll have to get rid of Fr&auml;ulein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Webling&rsquo;s voluminous yawn was stricken midway
into a gasp. Marie Louise told her the story of the diabolical
prayer. Lady Webling took the blow without reeling. She
expressed shock, but again expressed it too perfectly.</p>
<p>She promised to &ldquo;reprimand the foolish old soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To reprimand her!&rdquo; Marie Louise cried. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
send her away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send her away where, my child? Where should we send
the poor thing? But I&rsquo;ll speak to her very sharply. It was
outrageous of her. What if the children should say such
things before other people? It would be frightful! Thank
you for telling me, my dear. And now I&rsquo;m for bed! And
you should be. You look quite worn out. Coming up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Webling laughed and glanced at the study door,
implying and rejoicing in the implication that Marie Louise
was lingering for a last word with Easton.</p>
<p>Really she was trying to avoid climbing the long stairs
with Lady Webling&rsquo;s arm about her. For the first time in her
life she distrusted the perfection of the old soul&rsquo;s motives.
She felt like a Judas when Lady Webling offered her cheek
for another good-night kiss. Then she pretended to read
a book while she listened for Lady Webling&rsquo;s last puff as
she made the top step.</p>
<p>At once she poised for flight. But the study door opened
and Easton came out. He was bending down to murmur
into Sir Joseph&rsquo;s downcast countenance. Easton was saying,
with a tremulous emotion, &ldquo;This is the beginning of the end
of England&rsquo;s control of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise almost felt that there was a quiver of eagerness
rather than of dread in his tone, or that the dread was the
awe of a horrible hope.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Sir Joseph was brooding and shaking his head. He seemed
to start as he saw Marie Louise. But he smiled on her
dotingly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not gone to bed yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head and sorrowed over him with a sudden
rush of gratitude to his defense. She did not reward Easton&rsquo;s
smile with any favor, though he widened his eyes in admiration.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph said: &ldquo;Good night, Nicky. It is long before
I see you some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicholas nodded. &ldquo;But I shall see Miss Marie Louise
quite soon now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This puzzled Marie Louise. She pondered it while Nicky
bent and kissed her hand, heaved a guttural, gluttonous
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and went his way.</p>
<p>It was nearly a week later before she had a clue to the
riddle. Then Sir Joseph came home to luncheon unexpectedly.
He had an envelope with him, sealed with great red buttons
of wax. He asked Marie Louise into his office and said, with
an almost stealthy importance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, I have a little favor to ask of you. Sometimes,
you see, when I am having a big dealing on the Stock
Exchange I do not like that everybody knows my business.
Too many people wish to know all I do, so they can be doing
the same. What everybody knows helps nobody. It is
my wish to get this envelope to a man without somebody
finding out something. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa!&rdquo; Marie Louise answered with the utmost
confidence that what he did was good and wise and straight.
She experienced a qualm when Sir Joseph explained that
Nicky was the man. She wondered why he did not come to
the house. Then she rebuked herself for presuming to
question Sir Joseph&rsquo;s motives. He had never been anything
but good to her, and he had been so whole-heartedly good
that for her to give thought-room to a suspicion of him
was heinous.</p>
<p>He had business secrets and stratagems of tremendous
financial moment. She had known him to work up great
drives on the market and to use all sorts of people to prepare
his attacks. She did not understand big business methods.
She regarded them all with childlike bewilderment. When,
then, Sir Joseph asked her to meet Nicky, as if casually, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Regent&rsquo;s Park, and convey the envelope from her hand to
Nicky&rsquo;s without any one&rsquo;s witnessing the transfer, she felt
the elation of a child intrusted with an important errand.
So she walked all the way to Regent&rsquo;s Park with the long
strides of a young woman out for a constitutional. She
found a bench where she was told to, and sat down to bask
in the spring air, and wait.</p>
<p>By and by Easton sauntered along, lifted his hat to Marie
Louise, and made a great show of surprise. She rose and gave
him her hand. She had taken the precaution to wear gloves&ndash;&ndash;also
she had the envelope in her hand. She left it in
Nicky&rsquo;s. He smuggled it into his coat pocket, and murmuring,
&ldquo;So sorry I can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; lifted his hat and hurried off.</p>
<p>Marie Louise sat down again and after a time resumed her
constitutional.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph was full of thanks when she saw him at night.</p>
<p>Some days later he asked Marie Louise to meet Nicky
outside a Bond Street shop. She was to have a small parcel
and drop it. Nicky would stoop and pick it up and hand her
in its stead another of similar wrapper. She was to thank
him and come home.</p>
<p>Another day Marie Louise received from Sir Joseph a letter
and a request to take the children with her for a long walk,
ending at the Round Pond in Kensington Gardens. The
children carried their private navies with them and squatted
at the brim of the huge basin, poking their reluctant yachts to
sea. The boy Victor perfected a wonderful scheme for using
a long stick as a submarine. He thrust his arm under water
and from a distance knocked his sister&rsquo;s sailboat about till
its canvas was afloat and it filled and sank. All the while he
wore the most distant of expressions, but canny little Bettina
soon realized who had caused this catastrophe and how, and
she went for Victor of the U-stick with finger-nails and feet
and nearly rounded him into the toy ocean. It evidently
made a difference whose ship was gored.</p>
<p>Marie Louise darted forward to save Victor from a ducking as
well as a trouncing, and nearly ran over a man who was passing.</p>
<p>It was Ross Davidge, whiling away an hour between appointments.
He thought he recognized Marie Louise, but
he was not sure. Women in the morning look so unlike their
evening selves. He dared not speak.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>Davidge lingered around trying to get up the courage to
speak, but Marie Louise was too distraught with the feud
even to see him when she looked at him. She would not have
known him, anyway.</p>
<p>Davidge was confirmed in his guess at her identity by the
appearance of the man he had seen at her side at the dinner.
But the confirmation was Davidge&rsquo;s exile, for the fellow lifted
his hat with a look of great surprise and said to Marie Louise,
&ldquo;Fancy finding you heah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blah!&rdquo; said Davidge to himself, and went on about his
business.</p>
<p>Marie Louise did not pretend surprise at seeing Easton, but
went on scolding Victor and Bettina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of these other boys catch you playing submarine
they&rsquo;ll submarine you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she brought the proud Bettina to book with a, &ldquo;You
were so glad the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk, you see now how it
feels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the puerile incongruity of the rebuke, but it sufficed
to send Bettina into a cyclone of grief. She was already
one of those who are infinitely indifferent to the sufferings of
others and infinitesimally sensitive to their own.</p>
<p>When Nicky heard the story he gave Marie Louise a curious
look of disapproval and took Bettina into his lap. She was
also already one of those ladies who find a man&rsquo;s lap an excellent
consolation. He got rid of her adroitly and when
she and Victor were once more engaged in navigation Nicky
took up the business he had come for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I stop a moment?&rdquo; he said, and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a letter for you,&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>His roving eyes showed him that the coast was clear, and
he slipped a letter into her hand-bag which she opened, and
from it he took the letter she cautiously disclosed. He
chatted awhile and moved away.</p>
<p>This sort of meeting took place several times in several
places. When the crowds were too great or a bobby loitered
about, Nicky would murmur to Marie Louise that she had
better start home. He would take her arm familiarly and
the transfer of the parcel would be deftly achieved.</p>
<p>This messenger service went on for several weeks. Sir
Joseph apologized for the trouble he gave Marie Louise. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
seemed to be sincerely unhappy about it, and his little eyes
in their fat, watery bags peered at her with a tender regret
and an ulterior regret as well.</p>
<p>He explained a dozen times that he sent her because it was
such an important business and he had no one else to trust.
And Marie Louise, for all her anxiety, was sadly glad of his
confidence, regarded it as sacred, and would not violate it so
much as to make the least effort to learn what messages she
was carrying. Nothing, of course, would have been easier
than to pry open one of these envelopes. Sometimes the
lapel was hardly sealed. But she would as soon have peeked
into a bathroom.</p>
<p>Late in June the Weblings left town and settled in the great
country seat Sir Joseph had bought from a bankrupt American
who had bought it from nobility gone back to humility.
Here life was life. There were forests and surreptitious
pheasants, deer that would almost but never quite come to
call, unseen nightingales that sang from lofty nave and
transept like cherubim all wings and voice.</p>
<p>The house was usually full of guests, but they were careful
not to intrude upon their hosts nor their hosts upon them.
The life was like life at a big hotel. There was always a
little gambling to be had, tennis, golf, or music, or a quiet
chat, gardens to stroll and sniff or grub in, horses to ride,
motors at beck and call, solitude or company.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt came down for a week-end and struck
up a great friendship with the majestic Mrs. Prothero from
Washington, D. C., so grand a lady that even Lady C.-W.
was a bit in awe of her, so gracious a personage that even
Lady C.-W. could not pick a quarrel with her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero gathered Marie Louise under her wing and
urged her to visit her when she came to America. But Polly
Widdicombe had already pledged Marie Louise to make
her home her own on that side of the sea. Polly came down,
too, and had &ldquo;the time of her young life&rdquo; in doing a bit of
the women&rsquo;s war work that became the beautiful fashion
of the time. The justification of it was that it released men
for the trenches, but Polly insisted that it was shamefully
good sport.</p>
<p>She and Marie Louise went about in breeches and shirts
and worked like hostlers around the stables and in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
paddocks, breaking colts and mucking out stalls. They donned
the blouses and boots of peasants, and worked in the fields
with rake and hoe and harrow. They even tried the plow,
but they followed it too literally, and the scallopy furrows
they drew across the fields made the yokels laugh or grieve,
according to their natures.</p>
<p>The photographers were alive to the piquancy of these
revelations, and portraits of Marie Louise in knickers and
puttees, and armed with agricultural weapons, appeared in
the pages of all the weeklies along with other aristocrats and
commoners. Some of these even reached America.</p>
<p>There was just one flaw for Rosalind in this &ldquo;As You
Like It&rdquo; life and that was the persistence of the secret association
with Nicky. It was the strangest of clandestine
affairs.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had always liked to get out alone in a saddle
or behind the wheel of a runabout, and Sir Joseph, when he
came up from town, fell into the habit of asking her once
in a while to take another little note to Nicky.</p>
<p>She found him in out-of-the-way places. He would step
from a clump of bushes by the road and hail her car, or she
would overtake him and offer him a lift to his inn, or she
would take horse and gallop across country and find him
awaiting her in some lonely avenue or in the twist of a ravine.</p>
<p>He was usually so preoccupied and furtive that he made no
proffer of courtship; but once when he seemed peculiarly
triumphant he rode so close to her that their knees girded
and their spurs clashed, and he tried to clip her in his arms.
She gathered her horse and let him go, and he plunged ahead
so abruptly that the clinging Nicky dragged Marie Louise
from her saddle backward. He tried to swing her to the
pommel of his own, but she fought herself free and came to
the ground and was almost trampled. She was so rumpled
and so furious, and he so frightened, that he left her and
spurred after her horse, brought him back, and bothered her
no more that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever annoy me again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be the
last you&rsquo;ll see of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was too useful to be treated as a mere beauty, and she
had him cowed.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that Marie Louise, being silently urged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
to love Nicky, should helplessly resist the various appeals in
his behalf.</p>
<p>There is no worse enemy to love than recommendation.
There is something froward about the passion. It hangs back
like a fretful child, loathing what is held out for its temptation,
longing for the forbidden, the sharp, the perilous.</p>
<p>Next to being asked to love, trying to love is the gravest
impediment. Marie Louise kept telling herself that she ought
to marry Nicky, and herself kept refusing to obey.</p>
<p>From very perversity her heart turned to other interests.
She was desperately in love with soldiers <i>en masse</i> and individually.
There was safety in numbers and a canceling
rivalry between those who were going out perhaps to death
and those who had come back from the jaws of death variously
the worse for the experience.</p>
<p>The blind would have been irresistible in their groping
need of comfort, if there had not been the maimed of body
or mind putting out their incessant pleas for a gramercy of
love. Those whose wounds were hideous took on an uncanny
beauty from their sacrifice.</p>
<p>She busied herself about them and suffered ecstasies of
pity.</p>
<p>She wanted to go to France and get near to danger, to help
the freshly wounded, to stanch the spouting arteries, to lend
courage to the souls dismayed by the first horror of the
understanding that thenceforth they must go through life
piecemeal.</p>
<p>But whenever she made application she met some vague
rebuff. Her appeals were passed on and on and the blame
for their failure was referred always to some remote personage
impossible to reach.</p>
<p>Eventually it dawned on her that there was actually an
official intention to keep her out of France. This stupefied
her for a time. One day it came over her that she was
herself suspect. This seemed ridiculous beyond words
in view of her abhorrence of the German cause in large and in
detail. Ransacking her soul for an explanation, she ran upon
the idea that it was because of her association with the
Weblings.</p>
<p>She was ashamed to have given such a thought passage
through her mind. But it came back as often as she drove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
it out and then the thought began to hover about her that
perhaps the suspicion was not so insane as she believed.
The public is generally unreasonable, but its intuitions, like
a woman&rsquo;s, are the resultants of such complex instincts that
they are above analysis.</p>
<p>But the note-carrying went on, and she could not escape
from the suspicion or its shadow of disgrace. Like a hateful
buzzard it was always somewhere in her sky.</p>
<p>Once the suspicion had domiciled itself in her world, it was
incessantly confirmed by the minuti&aelig; of every-day existence.
The interchange of messages with Nicky Easton grew unexplainable
on any other ground. The theory of secret financial
dealings looked ludicrous; or if the dealings were financial,
they must be some of the trading with the enemy that was
so much discussed in the papers.</p>
<p>She felt that she had been conniving in one of the spy-plots
that all the Empire was talking about. She grew afraid
to the last degree of fear. She saw herself on the scaffold.
She resolved to carry no more messages.</p>
<p>But the next request of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s found her complying
automatically. It had come to be her habit to do what
he asked her to do, and to take pride in the service as
a small installment on her infinite debt. And every time
her resentment rose to an overboiling point, Sir Joseph
or Lady Webling would show her some exquisite kindness
or do some great public service that won commendation
from on high.</p>
<p>One day when she was keyed up to protest Lady Webling
discharged Fr&auml;ulein Ernst for her pro-Germanism and engaged
an English nurse. Another day Lady Webling asked
her to go on a visit to a hospital. There she lavished tenderness
on the British wounded and ignored the German. How
could Marie Louise suspect her of being anti-British? Another
time when Marie Louise was almost ready to rebel
she saw Sir Joseph&rsquo;s name heading a war subscription, and
that night he made, at a public meeting, a speech denouncing
Germany in terms of vitriol.</p>
<p>After all, Marie Louise was not English. And America was
still neutral. The President had wrung from Germany a
promise of better behavior, and in a sneaking way the promise
was kept, with many a violation quickly apologized for.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>Still, England wrestled for her life. There seemed to be
hardly room in the papers for the mere names of the dead
and the wounded, and those still more pitiable ones, the
missing.</p>
<p>Marie Louise lost many a friend, and all of her friends lost
and lost. She wore herself out in suffering for others, in visiting
the sick, the forlorn, the anxious, the newly bereaved.</p>
<p>The strain on Marie Louise&rsquo;s heart was the more exhausting
because she had a craven feeling all the while that perhaps she
was being used somehow as a tool for the destruction of English
plans and men. She tried to get the courage to open
one of those messages, but she was afraid that she might find
confirmation. She made up her mind again and again to
put the question point-blank to Sir Joseph, but her tongue
faltered. If he were guilty, he would deny it; if he were
innocent, the accusation would break his heart. She hated
Nicky too much to ask him. He would lie in any case.</p>
<p>She was nagged incessantly by a gadfly of conscience that
buzzed in her ears the counsel to tell the police. Sometimes
on her way to a tryst with Easton a spirit in her feet led her
toward a police station, but another spirit carried her past,
for she would visualize the sure consequences of such an
exposure. If her suspicions were false, she would be exposed
as a combination of dastard and dolt. If they were true,
she would be sending Sir Joseph and Lady Webling perhaps
to the gallows.</p>
<p>To betray those who had been so angelic to her was simply
unthinkable.</p>
<p>Irresolution and meditation made her a very Hamlet of
postponement and inaction. Hamlet had only a ghost for
counselor, and a mother to be the first victim of his rashness.
No wonder he hesitated. And Marie Louise had only hysterical
suspicion to account for her thoughts; and the victims
of her first step would be the only father and mother she
had ever really known. America itself was another Hamlet
of debate and indecision, weighing evidences, pondering
theories, deferring the sword, hoping that Germany would
throw away the baser half. And all the while time slid away,
lives slid away, nations fell.</p>
<p>In the autumn the town house was opened again. There
was much thinly veiled indignation in the papers and in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
circulation of gossip because of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s prominence in
English life. The Germans were so relentless and so various
in their outrages upon even the cruel usages of combat that
the sound of a German name grew almost unbearable. People
were calling for Sir Joseph&rsquo;s arrest. Others scoffed at the
cruelty and cowardice of such hysteria.</p>
<p>A once-loved prince of German blood had been frozen
out of the navy, and the internment camps were growing
like boom towns. Yet other Germans somehow were granted
an almost untrammeled freedom, and thousands who had
avoided evil activity were tolerated throughout the war.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph kept retorting to suspicion with subscription.
He took enormous quantities of the government loans. His
contributions to the Red Cross and the multitudinous charities
were more like endowments than gifts. How could Marie
Louise be vile enough to suspect him?</p>
<p>Yet in spite of herself she resolved at last to refuse further
messenger service. Then she learned that Nicky had left
England and gone to America on most important financial
business of a most confidential nature.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was too glad of her release to ask questions.
She rejoiced that she had not insulted her foster-parents
with mutiny, and she drudged at whatever war work the
committees found for her. They found nothing very picturesque,
but the more toilsome her labor was the more it
served for absolution of any evil she might have done.</p>
<p>And now that the dilemma of loyalty was taken from
her soul, her body surrendered weakly. She had time to fall
ill. It was enough that she got her feet wet. Her convalescence
was slow even in the high hills of Matlock.</p>
<p>The winter had passed, and the summer of 1916 had come
before Marie Louise was herself. The Weblings had moved
out to the country again; the flowers were back in the gardens;
the deer and the birds were in their summer garb and mood.
But now the house guests were all wounded soldiers and
nurses. Sir Joseph had turned over his estate for a war
hospital.</p>
<p>Lady Webling went among her visitors like a queen making
her rounds. Sir Joseph squandered money on his distinguished
company. Marie Louise joined them and took what comfort
she could in such diminution of pain and such contributions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
of war power as were permitted her. Those were the only
legitimate happinesses in the world.</p>
<p>The tennis-courts were peopled now with players glad of
one arm or one eye or even a demodeled face. On the golf-links
crutched men hobbled. The horses in the stables bore
only partial riders. The card-parties were squared by players
using hands made by hand. The music-room resounded
with five-finger improvisations and with vocalists who had
little but their voices left. They howled, &ldquo;Keep your head
down, Fritzie boy,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;We gave them hell at Neuve Chapelle,
and here we are and here we are again,&rdquo; or moaned love-songs
with a sardonic irony.</p>
<p>And the guests at tea! And the guests who could not come
to tea!</p>
<p>Young Hawdon was there. &ldquo;Well, Marie Louise,&rdquo; he had
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back from France, but not <i>in toto</i>. Fact is, I&rsquo;m
neither here nor there. Quite a sketchy party you have.
But we&rsquo;ll charge it all to Germany, and some day we&rsquo;ll collect.
Some day! Some day!&rdquo; And he burst into song.</p>
<p>The wonder was that there was so much bravery. At times
there was hilarity, but it was always close to tears.</p>
<p>The Weblings went back to London early and took Marie
Louise with them. She wanted to stay with the poor soldiers,
but Sir Joseph said that there was just as much for her to
do in town. There was no lack of poor soldiers anywhere.
Besides, he needed her, he said. This set her heart to plunging
with the old fear. But he was querulous and irascible nowadays,
and Lady Webling begged her not to excite him, for
she was afraid of a paralysis. He had the look of a Damocles
living under the sword.</p>
<p>The news from America was more encouraging to England
and to the Americans in England. German spies were being
arrested with amazing frequence. Ambassadors were floundering
in hot water and setting up a large traffic in return-tickets.
Even the trunks of certain &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; were
searched&ndash;&ndash;men and women who were amazed to learn that
curious German documents had got mixed up in their own
effects. Some most peculiar checks and receipts turned up.</p>
<p>It was shortly after a cloudy account of one of these trunk-raids
had been published in the London papers that Sir
Joseph had his first stroke of paralysis.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>Sir Joseph was in pitiful case. His devotion to Marie
Louise was heartbreaking. Her sympathy had not been exhausted,
but schooled rather by its prolonged exercise, and
she gave the forlorn old wretch a love and a tenderness that
had been wrought to a fine art without losing any of its
spontaneous reality.</p>
<p>At first he could move only a bit of the great bulk, sprawled
like a snowdrift under the sheet. He was helpless as a shattered
soldier, but slowly he won back his faculties and his
members. The doors that were shut between his brain and
his powers opened one by one, and he became a man again.</p>
<p>The first thing he wrote with his rediscovered right hand
was his signature to a document his lawyer brought him after
a consultation. It was a transfer of twenty thousand pounds
in British war bonds, &ldquo;for services rendered and other valuable
considerations,&rdquo; to his dear daughter Marie Louise Webling.</p>
<p>When the warrant was handed to her with the bundle of
securities, Marie Louise was puzzled, then shocked as the old
man explained with his still uncertain lips. When she understood,
she rejected the gift with horror. Sir Joseph pleaded
with her in a thick speech that had relapsed to an earlier
habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am theenkink how close I been by dyink. Du bist&ndash;&ndash;zhoo
are in my vwill, of coorse, but a man says, &lsquo;I vwill,&rsquo; and
some heirs says, &lsquo;You vwon&rsquo;t yet!&rsquo; Better I should make
sure of somethink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want money, papa&ndash;&ndash;not like this. And I
won&rsquo;t have you speak of wills and such odious things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been like our own daughter only more obeyink
as poor Hedwig. You should not make me sick by to
refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could only quiet him by accepting the wealth and
bringing him the receipt for its deposit in a safe of her own.</p>
<p>When he was once more able to hoist his massive body to
its feet and to walk to his own door, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mein</i>&ndash;&ndash;my <i>Gott</i>! Look at the calendar once. It is nineteen
seventeen already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased to be that simple, primitive thing, a sick man;
he became again the financier. She heard of him anew on
war-industry boards. She saw his name on lists of big
subscriptions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
He began to talk anew of Nicky, and he spoke with unusual
anxiety of U-boats. He hoped that they would have a bad
week. There was no questioning his sincerity in this.</p>
<p>And one evening he came home in a womanish flurry. He
pinched the ear of Marie Louise and whispered to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky is here in England&ndash;&ndash;safe after the sea voyage.
Be a nize girl, and you shall see him soon now.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning Marie Louise, waking, found her windows
opaque with fog. The gardens she usually looked
over, glistening green all winter through, were gone, and in
their place was a vast bale of sooty cotton packed so tight
against the glass that her eyes could not pierce to the sill.</p>
<p>Marie Louise went down to breakfast in a room like a smoky
tunnel where the lights burned sickly. She was in a murky
and suffocating humor, but Sir Joseph was strangely content
for the hour and the air. He ate with the zest of a boy on a
holi-morn, and beckoned her into his study, where he confided
to her great news:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky telephoned me. He brings wonderful news out of
America. Big business he has done. He cannot come yet by
our house, for even servants must not see him here. So you
shall go and meet him. You take your own little car, and go
most careful till you find Hyde Park gate. Inside you stop
and get out to see if something is matter with the engine.
A man is there&ndash;&ndash;Nicky. He steps in the car. You get in
and drive slowly&ndash;&ndash;so slowly. Give him this letter&ndash;&ndash;put in
bosom of dress not to lose. He tells you maybe something,
and he gives you envelope. Then he gets out, and you come
home&ndash;&ndash;but carefully. Don&rsquo;t let one of those buses run
you over in the fog. I should not risk you if not most
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise pleaded illness, and fear of never finding the
place. But Sir Joseph stared at her with such wonder and
pain that she yielded hastily, took the envelope, folded it
small, thrust it into her chest pocket and went out to the
garage, where she could hardly bully the chauffeur into letting
her take her own car. He put all the curtains on, and she
pushed forth into obfuscation like a one-man submarine.
There was something of the effect of moving along the floor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
of the sea. The air was translucent, a little like water-depths,
but everything was a blur.</p>
<p>Luck was with her. She neither ran over nor was run over.
But she was so tardy in finding the gate, and Nicky was so
damp, so chilled, and so uneasy with the apparitions and the
voices that had haunted him in the fog that he said nothing
more cordial than:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last! So you come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He climbed in, shivering with cold or fear. And she ran
the car a little farther into the nebulous depths. She gave
him the letter from Sir Joseph and took from him another.</p>
<p>Nicky did not care to tarry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should get back to my house with this devil&rsquo;s cold I&rsquo;ve
caught,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you still have no sun in this bedamned
England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;you&rdquo; struck Marie Louise as odd coming from a professed
Englishman, even if he did lay the blame for his accent
on years spent in German banking-houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find the United States?&rdquo; Marie Louise asked,
with a sudden qualm of homesickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those United States! Ha! United about what? Money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you can get along better afoot,&rdquo; said Marie Louise,
as she made a turn and slipped through the pillars of the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Au revoir!</i>&rdquo; said Nicky, and he dived out, slamming the
door back of him.</p>
<p>That night there was one of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s dinners. But
almost nobody came, except Lieutenant Hawdon and old
Mr. Verrinder. Sir Joseph and Lady Webling seemed more
frightened than insulted by the last-moment regrets of the
guests. Was it an omen?</p>
<p>It was not many days before Sir Joseph asked Marie Louise
to carry another envelope to Nicky. She went out alone,
shuddering in the wet and edged air. She found the bench
agreed on, and sat waiting, craven and mutinous. Nicky
did not come, but another man passed her, looked searchingly,
turned and came back to murmur under his lifted hat:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Webling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her stingiest &ldquo;Yis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Easton asked me to meet you in his place, and
explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not coming?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t. He is ill. A bad cold only. He has a letter
for you. Have you one for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise liked this man even less than she would have
liked Nicky himself. She was alarmed, and showed it. The
stranger said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. von Gr&ouml;ner, a frient of&ndash;&ndash;of Nicky&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise vibrated between shame and terror. But
von Gr&ouml;ner&rsquo;s credentials were good; it was surely Nicky&rsquo;s
hand that had penned the lines on the envelope. She took it
reluctantly and gave him the letter she carried.</p>
<p>She hastened home. Sir Joseph was in a sad flurry, but he
accepted the testimony of Nicky&rsquo;s autograph.</p>
<p>The next day Marie Louise must go on another errand.
This time her envelope bore the name of Nicky and the added
line, &ldquo;<i>Kindness of Mr. von Gr&ouml;ner.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Von Gr&ouml;ner tried to question Marie Louise, but her wits
were in an absolute maelstrom of terror. She was afraid of
him, afraid that he represented Nicky, afraid that he did not,
afraid that he was a real German, afraid that he was a pretended
spy, or an English secret-service man. She was afraid
of Sir Joseph and his wife, afraid to obey them or disobey
them, to love them or hate them, betray them or be betrayed.
She had lost all sense of direction, of impetus, of desire.</p>
<p>She saw that Sir Joseph and Lady Webling were in a state
of panic, too. They smiled at her with a wan pity and fear.
She caught them whispering often. She saw them cling together
with a devotion that would have been a burlesque in a
picture seen by strangers. It would have been almost as
grotesque as a view of a hippopotamus and his mate cowering
hugely together and nuzzling each other under the menace
of a lightning-storm.</p>
<p>Marie Louise came upon them once comparing the envelope
she had just brought with other letters of Nicky&rsquo;s. Sir
Joseph slipped them into a book, then took one of them out
cautiously and showed it to Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that look really like the writing from Nicky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, then, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; then, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; then,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Webling said, &ldquo;Sit down once, my child, and tell me
just how this man von Gr&ouml;ner does, acts, speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told them. They quizzed her. She was afraid that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
they would take her into their confidence, but they exchanged
querying looks and signaled caution.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph said: &ldquo;Strange how long Nicky stays sick, and
his memory&ndash;&ndash;little things he mixes up. I wonder is he dead
yet. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; Marie Louise cried. &ldquo;Dead, and sends you
letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but such a funny letter this last one is. I think I
write him once more and ask him is he dead or crazy, maybe.
Anyway, I think I don&rsquo;t feel so very good now&ndash;&ndash;mamma and
I take maybe a little journey. You come along with, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rush of desperate gratitude to the only real people in
her world led her to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you want me to do is what I want to do&ndash;&ndash;or
wherever to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Webling drew her to her breast, and Sir Joseph held
her hand in one of his and patted it with the flabby other,
mumbling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what is it we want you to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his eyes came a scurry of tears that ran in panic
among the folds of his cheeks. He shook them off and smiled,
nodding and still patting her hand as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better I write one letter more for Mr. von Gr&ouml;ner. I esk
him to come himself after dark to-night now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise waited in her room, watching the sunlight
die out of the west. She felt somehow as if she were a prisoner
in the Tower, a princess waiting for the morrow&rsquo;s little visit
to the scaffold. Or did the English shoot women, as Edith
Cavell had been shot?</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door, but it was not the turnkey.
It was the butler to murmur, &ldquo;Dinner, please.&rdquo; She went
down and joined mamma and papa at the table. There were
no guests except Terror and Suspense, and both of them wore
smiling masks and made no visible sign of their presence.</p>
<p>After dinner Marie Louise had her car brought round to the
door. There was nothing surprising about that. Women
had given up the ancient pretense that their respectability
was something that must be policed by a male relative or
squire except in broad daylight. Neither vice nor malaria
was believed any longer to come from exposure to the night air;
nor was virtue regarded like a sum of money that must not be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
risked by being carried about alone after dark. It had been
easy enough to lose under the old r&eacute;gime.</p>
<p>So Marie Louise launched out in her car much as a son of
the family might have done. She drove to a little square too
dingily middle class to require a policeman. She sounded her
horn three squawks and swung open the door, and a man
waiting under an appointed tree stepped from its shadow
and into the shadow of the car before it stopped. She dropped
into high speed and whisked out of the square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have for me a message,&rdquo; said Mr. von Gr&ouml;ner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Sir Joseph wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;at the house. We&rsquo;ll go there at once if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Delighted. But Nicky&ndash;&ndash;I ought to telephone
him I shall be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky is well enough to telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to come to the telephone, but there is a servant. If
you will please stop somewhere. I shall be a moment only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise felt that she ought not to stop, but she could
hardly kidnap the man. So she drew up at a shop and von
Gr&ouml;ner left her, her heart shaking her with a faint tremor
like that of the engine of her car.</p>
<p>Von Gr&ouml;ner returned promptly, but he said: &ldquo;I think we
should not go too straight to your father&rsquo;s house. Might
be we are followed. We can tell soon. Go in the park, please,
and suddenly stop, turn round, and I look at what cars follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let him command her. She was letting everybody
command her; she had no destination, no North Star in her
life. Von Gr&ouml;ner kept her dodging about Regent&rsquo;s Park till
she grew angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems rather silly, doesn&rsquo;t it? I am going home.
Sir Joseph has worries enough without&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he has worries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer. The eagerness in his voice did not
please her. He kept up a rain of questions, too, but she
answered them all by referring him to Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>At last they reached the house. As they got out, two men
closed in on the car and peered into their faces. Von Gr&ouml;ner
snapped at them, and they fell back.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had taken along her latchkey. She opened
the door herself and led von Gr&ouml;ner to Sir Joseph&rsquo;s room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>As she lifted her hand to knock she heard Lady Webling
weeping frantically, crying out something incoherent. Marie
Louise fell back and motioned von Gr&ouml;ner away, but he pushed
the door open and, taking her by the elbow, thrust her
forward.</p>
<p>Lady Webling stopped short with a wail. Sir Joseph,
who had been trying to quiet her by patting her hand, paused
with his palm uplifted.</p>
<p>Before Marie Louise could speak she saw that the old
couple was not alone. By the mantel stood Mr. Verrinder.
By the door, almost touching Marie Louise, was a tall, grim
person she had not seen. He closed the door behind von
Gr&ouml;ner and Marie Louise.</p>
<p>Mr. Verrinder said, &ldquo;Be good enough to sit down.&rdquo; To
von Gr&ouml;ner he said, &ldquo;How are you, Bickford?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Sir Joseph was staring at the new-comer, and his
German nativity told him what Marie Louise had not
been sure of, that von Gr&ouml;ner was no German. When
Verrinder gave him an English name it shook Marie Louise
with a new dismay. Sir Joseph turned from the man to
Marie Louise and demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie Louise, you ditt not theenk this man is a Cherman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This one more shame crushed Marie Louise. She dropped
into a chair, appealing feebly to the man she had retrieved:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is not von Gr&ouml;ner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bickford grinned. &ldquo;Well, in a manner of speakin&rsquo;. You
might say it&rsquo;s my pen-name. Not that I&rsquo;ve ever been in the
pen&ndash;&ndash;except with Nicky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky is in the&ndash;&ndash; He&rsquo;s not ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s a bit sick. He was a bit seasick to start with,
and when we gave him the collar&ndash;&ndash;well, he doesn&rsquo;t like his
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his letters&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Marie Louise pleaded, her fears racing
ahead of her questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always a hand at forgery, but I thought best to
turn it to the aid of me country. I&rsquo;m proud if you liked me
work. The last ones were not up to the mark. <i>I</i> was hurried,
and Nicky was ugly. He refused to answer any more
questions. I had to do it all on me own. Ahfterwards I
found I had made a few mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Marie Louise realized that this man had been calmly
taking the letters addressed to Nicky and answering them in
his feigned script to elicit further information from Sir Joseph
and enmesh him further, she dropped her hands at her sides,
feeling not only convicted of crime, but of imbecility as well.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph and Lady Webling spread their hands and drew
up their shoulders in surrender and gave up hope of bluff.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>Verrinder wanted to be merciful and avoid any more
climaxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s all up, Sir Joseph, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph drew himself again as high as he could, though
the burden of his flesh kept pulling him down. He did not
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Sir Joseph, be a sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Englishman&rsquo;s releechion,&rdquo; sneered Sir Joseph, &ldquo;to be
ein <i>Sportmann</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Verrinder.
&ldquo;It seems to be untranslatable into German&ndash;&ndash;just as we can&rsquo;t
seem to understand <i>Germanity</i> except that it is the antonym
of <i>humanity</i>. You fellows have no boyhood literature, I am
told, no Henty or Hughes or Scott to fill you with ideas of
fair play. You have no games to teach you. One really can&rsquo;t
blame you for being such rotters, any more than one can
blame a Kaffir for not understanding cricket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sport aside, use your intelligence, old man. <i>I</i>&rsquo;ve
laid my cards on the table&ndash;&ndash;enough of them, at least. We&rsquo;ve
trumped every trick, and we&rsquo;ve all the trumps outstanding.
You have a few high cards up your sleeve. Why not toss them
on the table and throw yourselves on the mercy of his
Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The presence of Marie Louise drove the old couple to a last
battle for her faith. Lady Webling stormed, &ldquo;All what you
accuse us is lies, lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder grew stern:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies, you say? We have you, and your daughter&ndash;&ndash;also
Nicky. We have&ndash;&ndash;well, I&rsquo;ll not annoy you with their names.
Over in the States they have a lot more of you fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Sir Joseph have lived in this country for years
and years. You have grown fat&ndash;&ndash;I mean to say rich&ndash;&ndash;upon
our bounty. We have loved and trusted you. His
Majesty has given you both marks of his most gracious favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We paid well for that,&rdquo; sneered Lady Webling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I fancy you did&ndash;&ndash;but with English pounds and
pence that you gained with the help of British wits and British
freedom. You have contributed to charities, yes, and handsomely,
too, but not entirely without the sweet usages of
advertisement. You have not hidden that part of your bookkeeping
from the public.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But the rest of your books&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t show those. We
know a ghastly lot about them, and it is not pretty, my dear
lady. I had hoped you would not force us to publish those
transactions. You have plotted the destruction of the British
Empire; you have conspired to destroy ships in dock and at
sea; you have sent God knows how many lads to their death&ndash;&ndash;and
women and children, too. You have helped to blow up
munitions-plants, and on your white heads is the blood of
many and many a poor wretch torn to pieces at his lathe.
You have made widows of women and orphans of children
who never heard of you, nor you of them. Nor have you
cared&ndash;&ndash;or dared&ndash;&ndash;to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Joseph has been perfecting a great scheme to buy
up what munitions-plants he could in this country in order
to commit sabotage and slow up the production of the ammunition
our troops are crying for. He has plotted with
others to send defective shells that will rip up the guns they
do not fit, and powders that will explode too soon or not at
all. God! to think that the lives of our brave men and the
life of our Empire should be threatened by such people as you!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the American field Sir Joseph has connived with a
syndicate to purchase factories, to stop production at the
source, since your U-boats and your red-handed diplomatic
spies cannot stop it otherwise. Your agents have corrupted
a few of the Yankees, and killed others, and would have
killed more if the name of your people had not become such a
horror even in that land where millions of Germans live that
every proffer is suspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we know you, Lady Webling and Sir Joseph.
We have watched you all the while from the very first, and
we know that you are not innocent even of complicity in the
supreme infamy of luring the <i>Lusitania</i> to her death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was quivering with the rush of his emotions over the
broken dam of habitual reticence.</p>
<p>Lady Webling and Sir Joseph had quivered, too, less under
the impact of his denunciation than in the confusion of their
own exposure to themselves and to Marie Louise.</p>
<p>They had watched her eyes as she heard Mr. Verrinder&rsquo;s
philippic. They had seen her pass from incredulity to belief.
They had seen her glance at them and glance away in fear
of them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>This broke them utterly, for she was utterly dear to them.
She was dearer than their own flesh and blood. She had replaced
their dead. She had been born to them without pain,
without infancy, born full grown in the prime of youth and
beauty. They had watched her love grow to a passion, and
their own had grown with it.</p>
<p>What would she do now? She was the judge they feared
above England. They awaited her sentence.</p>
<p>Her eyes wandered to them and searched them through.
At first, under the spell of Verrinder&rsquo;s denunciation, she saw
them as two bloated fiends, their hands dripping blood, their
lips framed to lies, their brains to cunning and that synonym
for Germanism, <i>ruthlessness</i>&ndash;&ndash;the word the Germans chose,
as their Kaiser chose Huns for an ideal.</p>
<p>But she looked again. She saw the pleading in their eyes.
Their very uncomeliness besought her mercy. After all,
she had seen none of the things Verrinder described. The
only real things to her, the only things she knew of her
own knowledge, were the goodnesses of these two. They
were her parents. And now for the first time they needed
her. The mortgage their generosity had imposed on her
had fallen due.</p>
<p>How could she at the first unsupported obloquy of a stranger
turn against them? Her first loyalty was due to them, and
no other loyalty was under test. Something swept her to her
feet. She ran to them and, as far as she could, gathered them
into her arms. They wept like two children whom reproaches
have hardened into defiance, but whom kindness has melted.</p>
<p>Verrinder watched the spectacle with some surprise and
not altogether with scorn. Whatever else Miss Webling was,
she was a good sport. She stuck to her team in defeat.</p>
<p>He said, not quite harshly, &ldquo;So, Miss Webling, you cast
your lot with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that what I said was true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, you should be careful. Those messages you carried
incriminate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they do, though I never knew what was in
them. No, I&rsquo;ll take that back. I&rsquo;m not trying to crawl out
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then since you confess so much, I shall have to ask you
to come with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the&ndash;&ndash;the Tower of London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The car is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise was stabbed with fright. She seized the
doomed twain in a faster embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with these poor souls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their souls my dear Miss Webling, are outside our
jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With their poor bodies, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a judge or a jury, Miss Webling. Everything
will be done with propriety. They will not be torpedoed in
midocean without warning. They will have the full advantage
of the British law to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That awful word jarred them all. But Sir Joseph was determined
to make a good end. He drew himself up with
another effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse, pleass, Mr. Verrinder&ndash;&ndash;might it be we should
take with us a few little things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thang gyou.&rdquo; He bowed and turned to go, taking his wife
and Marie Louise by the arm, for mutual support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll come along,&rdquo; said Mr. Verrinder.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph nodded. The three went heavily up the grandiose
stairway as if a gibbet waited at the top. They went into
Sir Joseph&rsquo;s room, which adjoined that of his wife. Mr.
Verrinder paused on the sill somewhat shyly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a most unpleasant task, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise hesitated, smiling gruesomely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My room is across the hall. You can hardly be in both
places at once, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I can trust you&ndash;&ndash;especially as the house is surrounded.
If you don&rsquo;t mind joining us later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise went to her room. Her maid was there in a
palsy of fear. The servants had not dared apply themselves
to the keyholes, but they knew that the master was visited
by the police and that a cordon was drawn about the house.</p>
<p>The ashen girl offered her help to Marie Louise, wondering
if she would compromise herself with the law, but incapable
of deserting so good a mistress even at such a crisis. Marie
Louise thanked her and told her to go to bed, compelled her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
to leave. Then she set about the dreary task of selecting a
few necessaries&ndash;&ndash;a nightgown, an extra day gown, some linen,
some silver, and a few brushes. She felt as if she were laying
out her own grave-clothes, and that she would need little and
not need that little long.</p>
<p>She threw a good-by look, a long, sweeping, caressing glance,
about her castle, and went across the hall, lugging her hand-bag.
Before she entered Sir Joseph&rsquo;s room she knocked.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Verrinder that answered, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was seated in a chair, dejected and making himself as
inoffensive as possible. Lady Webling had packed her own
bag and was helping the helpless Sir Joseph find the things
he was looking for in vain, though they were right before him.
Marie Louise saw evidences that a larger packing had already
been done. Verrinder had surprised them, about to flee.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph was ready at last. He was closing his bag when
he took a last glance, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My toot&rsquo;-brush and powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to his bathroom cabinet, and there he saw in the
little apothecary-shop a bottle of tablets prescribed for him
during his illness. It was conspicuously labeled &ldquo;<i>Poison</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood staring at the bottle so long in such fascination
that Lady Webling came to the door to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vat is it you could not find now, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned against the edge of the casement, and he pointed
to the bottle. Their eyes met, and in one long look they
passed through a brief Gethsemane. No words were exchanged.
She nodded. He took the bottle from the shelf
stealthily, unscrewed the top, poured out a heap of tablets
and gave them to her, then poured another heap into his fat
palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Prosit</i>!&rdquo; he said, and they flung the venom into their
throats. It was brackish merely from the coating, but they
could not swallow all the pellets. He filled a glass of water
at the faucet and handed it to his wife. She quaffed enough
to get the pellets down her resisting throat, and handed the
glass to him.</p>
<p>They remained staring at each other, trying to crowd into
their eyes an infinity of strange passionate messages, though
their features were all awry with nausea and the premonition
of lethal pains.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Verrinder began to wonder at their delay. He was about
to rise. Marie Louise went to the door anxiously. Sir
Joseph mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look once, my darlink. I find some bong-bongs. Vould
you like, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a childish canniness he held the bottle so that she
could see the skull and cross-bones and the word beneath.</p>
<p>Marie Louise, not realizing that they had already set out
on the adventure, gave a stifled cry and snatched at the bottle.
It fell to the floor with a crash, and the tablets leaped here
and there like tiny white beetles. Some of them ran out into
the room and caught Verrinder&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>Before he could reach the door Sir Joseph had said, triumphantly,
to Marie Louise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma and I did eat already. Too bad you do not come
vit. <i>Ad&eacute;, T&ouml;chterchen. Lebewohl!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was reaching his awkward arms out to clasp her when
Verrinder burst into the homely scene of their tragedy. He
caught up the broken bottle and saw the word &ldquo;<i>Poison</i>.&rdquo;
Beneath were the directions, but no word of description, no
mention of the antidote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this stuff?&rdquo; Verrinder demanded, in a frenzy of
dread and wrath and self-reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Marie Louise stammered.</p>
<p>Verrinder repeated his demand of Sir Joseph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Weiss nit</i>,&rdquo; he mumbled, beginning to stagger as the
serpent struck its fangs into his vitals.</p>
<p>Verrinder ran out into the hall and shouted down the stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bickford, telephone for a doctor, in God&rsquo;s name&ndash;&ndash;the
nearest one. Send out to the nearest chemist and fetch him
on the run&ndash;&ndash;with every antidote he has. Send somebody
down to the kitchen for warm water, mustard, coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a panic below, but Marie Louise knew nothing
except the swirling tempest of her own horror. Sir Joseph
and Lady Webling, blind with torment, wrung and wrenched
with spasms of destruction, groped for each other&rsquo;s hands
and felt their way through clouds of fire to a resting-place.</p>
<p>Marie Louise could give them no help, but a little guidance
toward the bed. They fell upon it&ndash;&ndash;and after a hideous while
they died.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>The physician arrived too late&ndash;&ndash;physicians were hard to
get for civilians. While he was being hunted down and
brought in, Verrinder fought an unknown poison with what
antidotes he could improvise, and saw that they merely added
annoyance to agony.</p>
<p>His own failure had been unnerving. He had pursued this
eminent couple for months, trying in vain to confirm suspicion
by proof and strengthen assurance with evidence, and always
delaying the blow in the hope of gathering in still more of
Germany&rsquo;s agents. At last he had thrown the slowly woven
net about the Weblings and revealed them to themselves as
prisoners of his cunning. Then their souls slipped out
through the meshes, leaving their useless empty bodies in his
care, their bodies and the soul and body of the young woman
who was involved in their guilt.</p>
<p>Verrinder did not relish the story the papers would make of
it. So he and the physician devised a statement for the
press to the effect that the Weblings died of something
they had eaten. The stomach of Europe was all deranged,
and Sir Joseph had been famous for his dinners; there was a
kind of ironic logic in his epitaph.</p>
<p>Verrinder left the physician to fabricate and promulgate
the story and keep him out of it. Then he addressed himself
to the remaining prisoner, Miss Marie Louise Webling.</p>
<p>He had no desire to display this minnow as his captive
after the whales had got away, but he hoped to find her useful
in solving some of the questions the Weblings had left unanswered
when they bolted into eternity. Besides, he had
no intention of letting Marie Louise escape to warn the other
conspirators and to continue her nefarious activities.</p>
<p>His first difficulty was not one of frightening Miss Webling
into submission, but of soothing her into coherence. She
had loved the old couple with a filial passion, and the sight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
of their last throes had driven her into a frenzy of grief.
She needed the doctor&rsquo;s care before Verrinder could talk to
her at all. The answers he elicited from her hysteria were full
of contradiction, of evident ignorance, of inaccuracy, of folly.
But so he had found all human testimony; for these three
things are impossible to mankind: to see the truth, to remember
it, and to tell it.</p>
<p>When first Marie Louise came out of the avalanche of her
woes, it was she who began the questioning. She went up and
down the room disheveled, tear-smirched, wringing her hands
and beating her breast till it hurt Verrinder to watch her
brutality to that tender flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&ndash;&ndash;what does it mean?&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;What have
you done to my poor papa and mamma? Why did you come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know? Only that they were good sweet people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good sweet spies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spies! Those poor old darlings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say&ndash;&ndash;really, now, you surely can&rsquo;t have the face,
the insolence, to&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any insolence. I haven&rsquo;t anything but a broken
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many hearts were broken&ndash;&ndash;how many hearts were
stopped, do you suppose, because of your work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refer to the lives that you destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I destroyed lives? Which one of us is going mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, now, you knew what you were doing. You
were glad and proud for every poor fellow you killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, then, that are mad.&rdquo; She stared at him in
utter fear. She made a dash for the door. He prevented
her. She fell back and looked to the window. He took
her by the arm and twisted her into a chair. He had seen
hysteria quelled by severity. He stood over her and spoke
with all the sternness of his stern soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will gain nothing by trying to make a fool of me.
You carried messages for those people. The last messages
you took you delivered to one of our agents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her soul refused her even self-defense. She could only
stammer the fact, hardly believing it as she put it forth:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what was in the letters. I never knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder was disgusted by such puerile defense:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think was in them, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea. Papa&ndash;&ndash;Sir Joseph didn&rsquo;t take me into
his confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you knew that they were secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that they were&ndash;&ndash;that they were business
messages&ndash;&ndash;secret financial transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transactions in British lives&ndash;&ndash;oh, they were that! And
you knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know it! I did not know it! I did not know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She realized too late that the strength of the retort suffered
by its repetition. It became nonsense on the third
iterance. She grew afraid even to defend herself.</p>
<p>Seeing how frightened she was at bay, Mr. Verrinder forebore
to drive her to distraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, you did not know what the messages contained.
But why did you consent to such sneaking methods? Why
did you let them use you for such evident deceit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was glad to be of use to them. They had been so
good to me for so long. I was used to doing as I was told.
I suppose it was gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Mr. Verrinder delivered himself of his
bitter opinion of gratitude, which has usually been so well
spoken of and so rarely berated for excess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gratitude is one of the evils of the world. I fancy that
few other emotions have done more harm. In moderation it
has its uses, but in excess it becomes vicious. It is a form
of voluntary servitude; it absolutely destroys all respect for
public law; it is the foundation of tyrannies; it is the secret
of political corruption; it is the thing that holds dynasties
together, family despotism; it is soul-mortgage, bribery. It
is a monster of what the Americans call graft. It is chloroform
to the conscience, to patriotism, to every sense of public
duty. &lsquo;Scratch my back, and I am your slave&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Verrinder rarely spoke at such length or with such
apothegm.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was a little more dazed than ever to hear
gratitude denounced. She was losing all her bearings. Next
he demanded:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But admitting that you were duped by your gratitude,
how did it happen that your curiosity never led you to inquire
into the nature of those messages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I respected Sir Joseph beyond all people. I supposed
that what he did was right. I never knew it not to be.
And then&ndash;&ndash;well, if, I did wonder a little once in a while, I
thought I&rsquo;d better mind my own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder had his opinion of this, too. &ldquo;Minding your
own business! That&rsquo;s another of those poisonous virtues.
Minding your own business leads to pacifism, malevolent
neutrality, selfishness of every sort. It&rsquo;s death to charity
and public spirit. Suppose the Good Samaritan had minded
his own business! But&ndash;&ndash; Well, this is getting us no forwarder
with you. You carried those messages, and never felt even
a woman&rsquo;s curiosity about them! You met Nicky Easton
often, and never noted his German accent, never suspected
that he was not the Englishman he pretended to be. Is that
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw by the wild look in her eyes and their escape from
his own that he had scored a hit. He did not insist upon
her acknowledging it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your only motive was gratitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked any pay for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never received anything for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We find the record of a transfer to you of securities for
some twenty thousand pounds. Why was that given you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it was just out of generosity. Sir Joseph said he was
afraid I might be&ndash;&ndash;that his will might be broken, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you discussed his will with him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was horrified at his implication. She cried, &ldquo;Oh, I
begged him not to, but he insisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said there were other heirs and they might contest his
will. Did he mention the heirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I don&rsquo;t think so. I don&rsquo;t remember that he
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not by any chance refer to the other grandparents
of the two children? Mr. and Mrs. Oakby, the father and
mother of the father of Victor and Bettina?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t refer to them, I&rsquo;m sure. Yes, I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say that his money would be left in trust for his
grandchildren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he gave you twenty thousand pounds just out of
generosity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, Mr. Verrinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fairish amount of money for messenger fees,
wasn&rsquo;t it? And it came to you while you were carrying those
letters to Nicky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Sir Joseph had been ill. He had had a stroke of
paralysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were afraid he might have another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not afraid of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I was, but&ndash;&ndash; What are you trying to
make me say&ndash;&ndash;that I went to him and demanded the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That idea occurs to you, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She writhed with disgust at the suggestion. Yet it had a
clammy plausibility. Mr. Verrinder went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These messages, you say, concerned a financial transaction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So papa told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never doubted him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the tortures of doubt that had assailed her recurred
to her now and paralyzed her power to utter the ringing
denial that was needed. He went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it strike you as odd that Sir Joseph should be
willing to pay you twenty thousand pounds just to carry
messages concerning some mythical business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer. She was afraid to commit herself to
anything. Every answer was a trap. Verrinder went on:
&ldquo;Twenty thousand pounds is a ten-per-centum commission
on two hundred thousand pounds. That was rather a
largish transaction to be carried on through secret letters,
eh? Nicky Easton was not a millionaire, was he? Now
I ask you, should you think of him as a Rothschild? Or
was he, do you think, acting as agent for some one else, perhaps,
and if so, for whom?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>She answered none of these. They were based on the
assumption that she had put forward herself. She could
find nothing to excuse her. Verrinder was simply playing
tag with her. As soon as he touched her he ran away and
came at her from another direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we know that you were only the adopted
daughter of Sir Joseph. But where did you first meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of that word startled her. That German name
stood for all the evils of the time. It was the inaccessible
throne of hell.</p>
<p>Verrinder was startled by it, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Berlin!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and nodded his head. &ldquo;Now
we are getting somewhere. Would you mind telling me the
circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed a furious scarlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please send me to the Tower and have me imprisoned for
life. I&rsquo;d rather be there than here. Or better yet&ndash;&ndash;have
me shot. It would make me happier than anything you could
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that your happiness is not the main object
of the moment. Will you be so good as to tell me how you
met Sir Joseph in&ndash;&ndash;in Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise drew a deep breath. The past that she had
tried to smother under a new life must be confessed at such
a time of all times!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know that Sir Joseph had a daughter; the
two children up-stairs are hers, and&ndash;&ndash;and what&rsquo;s to become
of them, in Heaven&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One problem at a time, if you don&rsquo;t mind. Sir Joseph
had a daughter. That would be Mrs. Oakby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Her husband died before her second baby was
born, and she died soon after. And Sir Joseph and Lady
Webling mourned for her bitterly, and&ndash;&ndash;well, a year or
so later they were traveling on the Continent&ndash;&ndash;in Germany,
they were, and one night they went to the Winter Garten
in Berlin&ndash;&ndash;the big music-hall, you know. Well, they were
sitting far back, and an American team of musicians came on&ndash;&ndash;the
Musical Mokes, we were called.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent her head in shame. &ldquo;I was one of them. I
played a xylophone and a saxophone and an accordion&ndash;&ndash;all
sorts of things. Well, Lady Webling gave a little gasp
when she saw me, and she looked at Sir Joseph&ndash;&ndash;so she told
me afterward&ndash;&ndash;and then they got up and stole &rsquo;way up front
just as I left the stage&ndash;&ndash;to make a quick change, you know.
I came back&ndash;&ndash;in tights, playing a big trombone, prancing
round and making an awful noise. Lady Webling gave a
little scream; nobody heard her because I made a loud blat
on the trombone in the ear of the black-face clown, and he
gave a shriek and did a funny fall, and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, pardon me&ndash;&ndash;why did Lady Webling scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I looked like her dead daughter. It was so
horrible to see her child come out of the grave in&ndash;&ndash;in tights,
blatting a trombone at a clown in that big variety theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can quite understand. And then&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir Joseph came round to the stage door and sent
in his card. The man who brought it grinned and told
everybody an old man was smitten on me; and Ben, the black-face
man, said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll break his face,&rsquo; but I said I wouldn&rsquo;t
see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I was dressed and leaving the theater with
the black-face man, you know, Sir Joseph was outside. He
stopped me and said: &lsquo;My child! My child!&rsquo; and the tears
ran down his face. I stopped, of course, and said, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter now?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Would you come with
me?&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;Not in a thousand years, old Creepo Christmas!&rsquo;
And he said: &lsquo;My poor wife is in the carriage at the
curb. She wants to speak to you.&rsquo; And then of course
I had to go, and she reached out and dragged me in and wept
all over me. I thought they were both crazy, but finally
they explained, and they asked me to go to their hotel with
them. So I told Ben to be on his way, and I went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they asked me a lot of questions, and I told them
a little&ndash;&ndash;not everything, but enough, Heaven knows. And
they begged me to be their daughter. I thought it would
be pretty stupid, but they said they couldn&rsquo;t stand the
thought of their child&rsquo;s image going about as I was, and
I wasn&rsquo;t so stuck on the job myself&ndash;&ndash;odd, how the old language
comes back, isn&rsquo;t it? I haven&rsquo;t heard any of it for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
so long I&rsquo;d almost forgotten it.&rdquo; She passed her handkerchief
across her lips as if to rub away a bad taste. It
left the taste of tears. She sighed: &ldquo;Well, they adopted
me, and I learned to love them. And&ndash;&ndash;and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you learned to love their native country, too, I
fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I did like Germany pretty well. They were crazy
about us in Berlin. I got my first big money and notices
and attention there. You can imagine it went to my head.
But then I came to England and tried to be as English as I
could, so as not to be conspicuous. I never wanted to be
conspicuous off the stage&ndash;&ndash;or on it, for that matter. I even
took lessons from the man who had the sign up, you remember,
&lsquo;Americans taught to speak English!&rsquo; I always had a gift
for foreign languages, and I got to thinking in English, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, please. Did you say &lsquo;Americans taught?&rsquo;
Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damned stupid of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder frowned. This complicated matters. He had
cornered her, only to have her abscond into neutral territory.
He had known that Marie Louise was an adopted child, but
had not suspected her Americanism. This required a bit of
thinking. While he studied it in the back room of his brain
his forehead self was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Sir Joseph befriended you, and that was what won your
amazing, unquestioning gratitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That and a thousand thousand little kindnesses. I loved
them like mother and father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your own&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;mother and father&ndash;&ndash;you must have
had parents of your own&ndash;&ndash;what was their nationality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they were, as we say, &lsquo;Americans from &rsquo;way back.&rsquo;
But my father left my mother soon after I was born. We
weren&rsquo;t much good, I guess. It was when I was a baby. He
was very restless, they say. I suppose I got my runaway
nature from him. But I&rsquo;ve outgrown that. Anyway, he left
my mother with three children. My little brother died. My
mother was a seamstress in a little town out West&ndash;&ndash;an awful
hole it was. I was a tiny little girl when they took me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
my mother&rsquo;s funeral. I remember that, but I can&rsquo;t remember
her. That was my first death. And now this! I&rsquo;ve lost a
mother and father twice. That hasn&rsquo;t happened to many
people. So you must forgive me for being so crazy. So
many of my loved are dead. It&rsquo;s frightful. We lose so
many as we grow up. Life is like walking through a graveyard,
with the sextons always busy opening new places. There
was so much crying and loneliness before, and now this war
goes on and on&ndash;&ndash;as if we needed a war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise went to the window and raised the curtain.
A haggard gray light had been piping the edges of the
shade. Now the full casement let in a flood of warm
morning radiance.</p>
<p>The dull street was alive again. Sparrows were hopping.
Wagons were on the move. Small and early tradesfolk were
about their business. Servants were opening houses as shops
were being opened in town.</p>
<p>The big wheel had rolled London round into the eternal
day. Doors and windows were being flung ajar. Newspapers
and milk were taken in, ashes put out, cats and dogs
released, front stoops washed, walks swept, gardens watered.
Brooms were pendulating. In the masters&rsquo; rooms it was still
night and slumber-time, but humble people were alert.</p>
<p>The morning after a death is a fearful thing. Those
papers on the steps across the way were doubtless loaded with
more tragedies from the front, and among the cruel facts
was the lie that concealed the truth about the Weblings,
who were to read no more morning papers, eat no more
breakfasts, set out on no more journeys.</p>
<p>Grief came to Marie Louise now with a less brackish taste.
Her sorrow had the pity of the sunlight on it. She wept not
now for the terror and hatefulness of the Weblings&rsquo; fate,
but for the beautiful things that would bless them no more,
for the roses that would glow unseen, the flowers that would
climb old walls and lean out unheeded, asking to be admired
and proffering fragrance in payment of praise. The Weblings
were henceforth immune to the pleasant rumble of wagons
in streets, to the cheery good mornings of passers-by, the
savor of coffee in the air, the luscious colors of fruits piled
upon silver dishes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>Then she heard a scamper of bare feet, the squeals of mischief-making
children escaping from a pursuing nurse.</p>
<p>It had been a favorite pastime of Victor and Bettina to
break in upon Marie Louise of mornings when she forgot to
lock her door. They loved to steal in barefoot and pounce
on her with yelps of savage delight and massacre her, pull
her hair and dance upon her bed and on her as she pleaded
for mercy.</p>
<p>She heard them coming now, and she could not reach the
door before it opened and disclosed the grinning, tousle-curled
cherubs in their sleeping-suits.</p>
<p>They darted in, only to fall back in amazement. Marie
Louise was not in bed. The bed had not been slept in.
Marie Louise was all dressed, and she had been crying.
And in a chair sat a strange, formidable old gentleman who
looked tired and forlorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; they gasped.</p>
<p>She dropped to her knees, and they ran to her for refuge from
the strange man.</p>
<p>She hugged them so hard that they cried, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without in the least understanding what it was all about,
they heard her saying to the man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now what&rsquo;s to become of these poor lambs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old stranger passed a slow gray hand across his dismal
face and pondered.</p>
<p>The children pointed, then remembered that it is impolite
to point, and drew back their little index hands and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie, what you up so early for?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she whispered, &ldquo;S-h-h!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being denied the answer to this charade, they took up a
new interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder is grandpapa up, too, and all dressed,&rdquo; said
Victor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe grandmamma,&rdquo; Bettina shrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you to their room,&rdquo; said Victor.</p>
<p>Marie Louise seized them by their hinder garments as they
fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not bother them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Victor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will so!&rdquo; said Bettina, pawing to be free.</p>
<p>Marie Louise implored: &ldquo;Please, please! They&rsquo;ve gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cast her eyes up at that terrible query, and answered
it vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have told a fellow good-by,&rdquo; Victor brooded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&ndash;&ndash;they forgot, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that was very nice of them,&rdquo; Bettina pouted.</p>
<p>Victor was more cheerful. &ldquo;Perhaps they did; perhaps
they kissed us while we was asleep&ndash;&ndash;<i>were</i> asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina accepted with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I &rsquo;member somebody kissin&rsquo; me. Yes, I
&rsquo;member now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor was skeptical. &ldquo;Maybe you only had a dream about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else is there?&rdquo; said Mr. Verrinder, rising and patting
Victor on the shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better run along to your
tubs now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They recognized the authority in his voice and obeyed.</p>
<p>The children took their beauty with them, but left their
destiny to be arranged by higher powers, the gods of Eld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to become of them,&rdquo; Louise groaned again, &ldquo;when
I go to prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder was calm. &ldquo;Sir Joseph&rsquo;s will doubtless left the
bulk of his fortune to them. That will provide for their
finances. And they have two grandparents left. The Oakbys
will surely be glad to take the children in, especially as they
will come with such fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that I am to have no more to do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be best to remove them to a more strictly
English influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hurt her horribly. She grew impatient for the finishing
blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now that they are disposed of, have you decided
what&rsquo;s to become of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to decide. By the by, have you any one
to represent you or intercede for you here, or act as your
counsel in England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;A good many people have been
very nice to me, of course. I&rsquo;ve noticed, though, that even
they grew cold and distant of late. I&rsquo;d rather die than ask
any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But have you no relatives living&ndash;&ndash;no one of importance
in the States who could vouch for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head with a doleful humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of our family were ever important that I ever heard
of, though of course one never knows what relatives are
lurking about. Mine will never claim me; that&rsquo;s certain.
I did have a sister&ndash;&ndash;poor thing!&ndash;&ndash;if she&rsquo;s alive. We didn&rsquo;t
get along very well. I was too wild and restless as a girl.
She was very good, hard-working, simple, homely as sin&ndash;&ndash;or
homely as virtue. I was all for adventure. I&rsquo;ve had my fill of
it. But once you begin it, you can&rsquo;t stop when you&rsquo;ve had
enough. If she&rsquo;s not dead, she&rsquo;s probably married and living
under another name&ndash;&ndash;Heaven knows what name or where.
But I could find her, perhaps. I&rsquo;d love to go to her. She
was a very good girl. She&rsquo;s probably married a good man
and has brought up her children piously, and never mentioned
me. I&rsquo;d only bring disgrace on her. She&rsquo;d disown me if I
came home with this cloud of scandal about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one shall know of this scandal unless you tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed harshly, with a patronizing superiority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Verrinder, did you ever know a secret to be
kept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed again at him, then at herself.</p>
<p>He rose wearily. &ldquo;I think I shall have to be getting along.
I haven&rsquo;t had a bath or a shave to-day. I shall ask you to keep
to your room and deny yourself to all visitors. I won&rsquo;t ask
you to promise not to escape. If the guard around the house
is not capable of detaining you, you&rsquo;re welcome to your
freedom, though I warn you that England is as hard to get
out of as to get into nowadays. Whatever you do, for your
own sake, at least, keep this whole matter secret and stick to
the story we agreed on. Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed himself out. No rattling of chains marked his
closing of the door, but if he had been a turnkey in Newgate
he could not have left Marie Louise feeling more a prisoner.
Her room was her body&rsquo;s jail, but her soul was in a dungeon,
too.</p>
<p>As Verrinder went down the hall he scattered a covey of
whispering servants.</p>
<p>The nurse who had waited to seize the children when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
came forth had left them to dress themselves while she hastened
to publish in the servants&rsquo; dining-room the appalling fact
that she had caught sight of a man in Miss Marie Louise&rsquo;s
room. The other servants had many other even more
astounding things to tell&ndash;&ndash;to wit: that after mysterious
excitements about the house, with strange men going and
coming, and the kitchen torn to pieces for mustard and warm
milk and warm water and strong coffee, and other things,
Sir Joseph and Lady Webling were no more, and the whole
household staff was out of a job. Strange police-like persons
were in the house, going through all the papers in Sir Joseph&rsquo;s
room. The servants could hardly wait to get out with the
gossip.</p>
<p>And Mr. Verrinder had said that this secret would be kept!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Somewhere along about this time, though there is no
record of the exact date&ndash;&ndash;and it was in a shabby home
in a humble town where dates made little difference&ndash;&ndash;a homely
woman sniffed.</p>
<p>Her name was Mrs. Nuddle.</p>
<p>What Mrs. Nuddle was sniffing at was a page of fashion
cartoons, curious human hieroglyphs that women can read and
run to buy. Highly improbable garments were sketched on
utterly impossible figures&ndash;&ndash;female eels who could crawl
through their own garters, eels of strange mottlings, with
heads like cranberries, feet like thorns, and no spines at all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle was as opposite in every way as could be.
She could not have crawled through her own washtub if she
had knocked the bottom out of it. She was a caricature made
by nature and long, hard work, and she laughed at the caricatures
devised by art in a hurry.</p>
<p>She was about to cast the paper aside as a final rebuke
when she caught sight of portraits of real people of fashion.
They did not look nearly so fashionable as the cartoons, but
they were at least possible. Some of them were said to be
prominent in charity; most of them were prominent out of
their corsages.</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Nuddle sniffed at character, not at caricature.
Leaning against her washtub and wringer, both as graceful
as their engineer, she indulged herself in the pitiful but unfailing
solace of the poor and the ugly, which is to attribute
to the rich dishonesty and to the beautiful wickedness.</p>
<p>The surf Mrs. Nuddle had raised in the little private sea
of her tub had died down, and a froth of soap dried on the
rawhide of her big forearms as her heifer eyes roamed the
newspaper-gallery of portraits. One sudsy hand supported
and suppressed her smile of ridicule. These women, belles
and swells, were all as glossy as if they had been ironed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle sneered: &ldquo;If the hussies would do an honest
day&rsquo;s work it would be better for their figgers.&rdquo; She was
mercifully oblivious of the fact that her tub-calisthenics had
made her no more exquisite than a cow in a kimono.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle scorned the lily-fingered tulip-fleshed beauties.
Their sentimental alarms had nothing in common with her
problem, which was the riddle of a husband who was faithful
only to the bottle, who was indifferent to the children he got
so easily, and was poetical only in that he never worked save
when the mood was on him.</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Nuddle made to cast aside the paper that had
come into her home wrapped round a bundle of laundry.
But now she was startled, and she would have startled anybody
who might have been watching her, for she stared hard at a
photographed beauty and gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She in her disordered garb, unkempt, uncorseted, and
uncommonly common, greeted with the word &ldquo;Sister!&rdquo; the
photograph of a very young, very beautiful, very gracile
creature, in a mannish costume that emphasized her femininity,
in a foreign garden, in a braw hat with curls cascading from
under it, with a throat lilying out of a flaring collar, with
hands pocketed in a smart jacket, and below that a pair of
most fashionable legs in riding-breeches and puttees! She
carried not a parasol nor a riding-crop, but a great reaping-hook
swung across her shoulder, and she smiled as impudently,
as immortally, as if she were Youth and had slain old Time
and carried off his scythe.</p>
<p>The picture did not reply to Mrs. Nuddle&rsquo;s cry, but Mrs.
Nuddle&rsquo;s eldest daughter, a precocious little adventuress of
eleven or so, who was generally called &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; turned from
the young brother whose smutty face she was just smacking
and snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, whatcha want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Sister supposed that her irritating mother was going
to tell her to stop doing something, or to start doing something&ndash;&ndash;either
of which behests she always hated and only
obeyed because her mother was bigger than she was. She
turned and saw her mother swaying and clutching at the air.
Sister had a gorgeous hope that mother would fall into the
tub and be interesting for once. But mother was a born
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
disappointer. She shook off the promising swoon, righted
herself, and began fiercely to scan the paper to find out whose
name the picture bore. The caption was torn off.</p>
<p>Being absolutely sure who it was, she wanted to find out
who it really was.</p>
<p>In her frantic curiosity she remembered that her husband
had stripped off a corner of the paper, dipped it in the stove,
lighted his pipe with it, thrown it flaming on the floor, spat it
out with practised accuracy, and trodden it as he went away.
Mrs. Nuddle ran to pick it up.</p>
<p>On the charred remnant she read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Beautiful Miss....
One of London&rsquo;s reigning beaut....
daughter of Sir Joseph W....
doing farm work on the estate in....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle sniffed no more. She flopped to a backless
chair and squatted in a curious burlesque of Rodin&rsquo;s statue of
&ldquo;The Thinker.&rdquo; One heavy hand pinched her dewlap. Her hair
was damp with steam and raining about her face. Her old waist
was half buttoned, and no one would have regretted if it had
been all buttoned. She was as plebeian as an ash-can and as
full of old embers.</p>
<p>She was still immobilized when her husband came in. Now
he gasped. His wife was loafing! sitting down! in the middle
of the day! Thinking was loafing with her. He was supposed
to do the family thinking. It was doubly necessary that she
should work now, because he was on a strike. He had been to
a meeting of other thinkers&ndash;&ndash;ground and lofty thinkers who
believed that they had discovered the true evil of the world
and its remedy.</p>
<p>The evil was the possession of money by those who had
accumulated it. The remedy was to take it away from them.
Then the poor would be rich, which was right, and the rich
would be poor, which was righter still.</p>
<p>It was well known that the only way to end the bad habit of
work was to quit working. And the way to insure universal
prosperity was to burn down the factories and warehouses,
destroy all machinery and beggar the beasts who invented,
invested, built, and hired and tried to get rich by getting riches.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>This program would take some little time to perfect, and
meanwhile Jake was willing that his wife should work. Indeed,
a sharp fear almost unmanned him&ndash;&ndash;what if she should fall
sick and have to loaf in the horsepital? What if she should die?
O Gord! Her little children would be left motherless&ndash;&ndash;and
fatherless, for he would, of course, be too busy saving the world
to save his children. He would lose, too, the prestige enjoyed
only by those who have their money in their wife&rsquo;s name. So
he spoke to her with more than his wonted gentleness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatta hellsa matter wit choo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt the unusual concern in his voice, and smiled at him
as best she could:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a kind of a jolt. I seen this here pitcher, and I thought
for a minute it was my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister? How&rsquo;d she get her pitcher in the paper?
Who did she shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched the sheet from her and saw the young woman
in the young-manly garb.</p>
<p>Jake gloated over the picture: &ldquo;Some looker! What is she,
a queen in burlecue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle held out the burned sliver of paper.</p>
<p>He roared. &ldquo;London&rsquo;s ranging beaut? And you&rsquo;re what
thinks she&rsquo;s your sister! The one that ran away? Was she
a beaut like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle nodded. He whistled and said, with great tact:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheese! but I have the rotten luck! Why didn&rsquo;t I see
her first? Whyn&rsquo;t you tell me more about her? You never
talk about her none. Why not?&rdquo; No answer. &ldquo;All I know
is she went wrong and flew the coop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle flared at this. &ldquo;Who said she went wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo; Jake retorted with vigor. &ldquo;Usedn&rsquo;t you to keep
me awake praying for her&ndash;&ndash;hollerin&rsquo; at God to forgive her?
Didn&rsquo;t you, or did you?&rdquo; No answer. &ldquo;And you think this
is her!&rdquo; The ridiculousness of the fantasy smote him. &ldquo;Say,
you must &rsquo;a&rsquo; went plumb nutty! Bendin&rsquo; over that tub must
&rsquo;a&rsquo; gave you a rush of brains to the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed uproariously till she wanted to kill him. She
tried to take back what she had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you set there tellin&rsquo; me I ever told you nothin&rsquo;
mean about my pore little sister. She was as good a girl as
ever lived, Mamise was.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re changin&rsquo; your tune now, ain&rsquo;tcha? Because you
think she looks like a grand dam in pants! And where dya
get that Mamise stuff? What was her honestogawd name?
Maryer? You&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; to swell her up a little, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t. She was named Marie Louise after her gran&rsquo;-maw,
on&rsquo;y as a baby she couldn&rsquo;t say it right. She said &lsquo;Mamise.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s what she called her poor little self&ndash;&ndash;Mamise.
Seems like I can see her now, settin&rsquo; on the floor like Sister.
And where is she now? O Gawd! whatever become of her,
runnin&rsquo; off thataway&ndash;&ndash;a little sixteen-year-ol&rsquo; chile, runnin&rsquo; off
with a cheap thattical troupe, because her aunt smacked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never had no maw and no bringin&rsquo; up, and she was so
pirty. She had all the beauty of the fambly, folks all said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that ain&rsquo;t no lie,&rdquo; said Jake, with characteristic gallantry.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but monopoly everywheres in the
world. She got all the looks and I got you. I wonder who got
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake sighed as he studied the paper, ransacked it noisily for
an article about her, but, finding none, looked at the date
and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, this paper&rsquo;s nearly a year old&ndash;&ndash;May, 1916, it says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This quelled his curiosity a little, and he turned to his dinner,
flinging it into his jaws like a stoker. His wife went slip-slopping
from stove to table, ministering to him.</p>
<p>Jake Nuddle did not look so dangerous as he was. He was
like an old tomato-can that an anarchist has filled with dynamite
and provided with a trigger for the destruction of whosoever
disturbs it. Explosives are useful in place. But Jake
was of the sort that blow up regardless of the occasion.</p>
<p>His dynamite was discontent. He hated everybody who
was richer or better paid, better clothed, better spoken of than
he was. Yet he had nothing in him of that constructive envy
which is called emulation and leads to progress, to days of
toil, nights of thought. His idea of equality was not to climb
to the peak, but to drag the climbers down. Prating always
of the sufferings of the poor, he did nothing to soothe them or
remove them. His only contribution to the improvement of
wages was to call a strike and get none at all. His contribution
to the war against oppressive capital was to denounce all
successful men as brutes and tyrants, lumping the benefactors
with the malefactors.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>Men of his type made up the blood-spillers of the French
Revolution, and the packs of the earlier Jacquerie, the thugs
who burned ch&acirc;teaux and shops, and butchered women as
well as men, growling their ominous refrain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noo sum zum cum eel zaw&rdquo; (&ldquo;<i>Nous sommes hommes comme
ils sont</i>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Jake Nuddles were hate personified. They formed secret
armies of enemies now inside the nation and threatened her
success in the war. The thing that prevented their triumph
was that their blunders were greater than their malice, their
folly more certain than their villainy. As soon as America
entered the lists against Germany, the Jake Nuddles would begin
doing their stupid best to prevent enlistment, to persuade
desertion, to stop war-production, to wreck factories and
trains, to ruin sawmills and burn crops. In the name of freedom
they would betray its most earnest defenders, compel the
battle-line to face both ways. They were more subtle than
the snaky spies of Germany, and more venomous.</p>
<p>As he wolfed his food now, Jake studied the picture of Marie
Louise. The gentlest influence her beauty exerted upon him
was a beastly desire. He praised her grace because it tortured
his wife. But even fiercer than his animal impulse was his rage
of hatred at the look of cleanliness and comeliness, the environment
of luxury only emphasized by her peasant disguise.</p>
<p>When he had mopped his plate with his bread, he took up
the paper again and glared at it with hostile envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dammer and her arristocratic ways! Daughter of a Sir
and a Lady, eh? Just wait till we get through with them Sirs
and Ladies. We&rsquo;ll mow &rsquo;em down. You&rsquo;ll see. Robbin&rsquo; us
poor toilers that does all the work! We&rsquo;ll put an end to their
peerages and their deer-parks. What Germany leaves of these
birds we&rsquo;ll finish up. And then we&rsquo;ll take this rotten United
States, the rottenest tyranny of all. Gawdammit! You just
wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife just waited till he had smashed the picture in the
face, knocked the pretty lady&rsquo;s portrait to the floor and walked
on it as he strode out to his revolution. Incidentally he trod
on little Sister&rsquo;s hand, and she sent up a caterwaul. Her little
brother howled in duet. Then father turned on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, shut up or I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish his sentence. He rarely finished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
anything&ndash;&ndash;except his meals. He left his children crying and his wife
in a new distress; but then, revolutions cannot pause for
women and children.</p>
<p>When he had gone, and Sister&rsquo;s tears had dried on her smutty
face, Mrs. Nuddle picked up the smitten and trampled picture
of England&rsquo;s reigning beauty and thought how lucky Miss
W. was to be in England, blissful on Sir and Lady Somebody-or-other&rsquo;s
estate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>When Mr. Verrinder left Marie Louise he took from
her even the props of hostility. She had nothing to
lean on now, nobody to fight with for life and reputation.
She had only suspense and confusion. Agitated thoughts followed
one another in waves across her soul&ndash;&ndash;grief for her
foster-father and mother, memory of their tendernesses,
remorse for seeming to have deserted them in their last hours,
remorse for having been the dupe of their schemes, and remorse
for that remorse, grief at losing the lovable, troublesome children,
creature distress at giving up the creature comforts of
the luxurious home, the revulsion of her unfettered mind and
her restless young body at the prospect of exchanging liberty
and occupation for the half-death of an idle cell&ndash;&ndash;a kind of
coffin residence&ndash;&ndash;fear of being executed as a spy, and fear of
being released to drag herself through life with the ball and
chain of guilt forever rolling and clanking at her feet.</p>
<p>Verrinder&rsquo;s mind was hardly more at rest when he left her
and walked to his rooms. He carried the regret of a protector
of England who had bungled his task and let the wards of his
suspicion break loose. The fault was not his, but he would
never escape the reproach. He had no taste for taking revenge
on the young woman. It would not salve his pride to
visit on her pretty head the thwarted punishments due Sir
Joseph and his consort in guilt. Besides, in spite of his cynicism,
he had been touched by Marie Louise&rsquo;s sincerities. She
proved them by the very contradictions of her testimony, with
its history of keen intelligence alternating with curious blindness.
He knew how people get themselves all tangled up in
conflicting duties, how they let evils slide along, putting off
till to-morrow the severing of the cords and the stepping forth
with freedom from obligation. He knew that the very best
people, being those who are most sensitive to gratitude and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
to other people&rsquo;s pains, are incessantly let in for complications
that never involve selfish or self-righteous persons.</p>
<p>As an executive of the law, he knew how many laws there
are unwritten and implied that make obedience to the law an
experiment in caddishness and ingratitude. There were reasons
enough then to believe that Marie Louise had meant
no harm and had not understood the evil in which she was so
useful an accomplice. Even if she were guilty and her bewilderment
feigned, her punishment would be untimely at this
moment when the Americans who abhorred and distrusted
Germany had just about persuaded the majority of their
countrymen that the world would be intolerable if Germany
triumphed, and that the only hope of defeating her tyranny lay
in joining hands with England, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>The enemies of England would be only too glad to make a
martyr out of Miss Webling if she were disciplined by England.
She would be advertised, as a counterweight to the
hideous mistake the Germans made in immortalizing with
their bullets the poor little nurse, &ldquo;<i>die</i> Cavell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder was not himself at all till he had bathed, shaved,
and clothed his person in clean linen and given his inner man
its tea and toast. Once this restoration was made, his tea
deferred helped him to the conclusion that the one wise thing
was to restore Marie Louise quietly to her own country. He
went with freshened step and determined mind to a conference
with the eminent men concerned. He made his own confession
of failure and took more blame than he need have accepted.
Then he told his plans for Marie Louise and made the council
agree with him.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon he called on Miss Webling and found
the house a flurry of undertakers, curious relatives, and
thwarted reporters. The relatives and the reporters he satisfied
with a few well-chosen lies. Then he sent his name up
to Marie Louise. The butler thrust the card-tray through the
door as if he were tossing a bit of meat to some wild animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down,&rdquo; said Marie Louise, and she primped herself
like another Mary Queen of Scots receiving a call from the
executioner. She was calmed by the hope that she would
learn her fate, at least, and she cared little what it was, so
long as it was not unknown.</p>
<p>Verrinder did not delay to spread his cards on the table.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Webling, I begin again with a question: If we should
offer you freedom and silence, would you go back to America
and tell no one of what has happened here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mere hint was like flinging a door open and letting
the sunlight into a dungeon. The very word &ldquo;America&rdquo;
was itself a rush of fresh air. The long-forgotten love of
country came back into her heart on a cry of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t mean that you might?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might. In fact, we will, if you will promise&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not wait for his formal conclusion. She broke
in: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything&ndash;&ndash;anything! Oh I don&rsquo;t want
to be free just for the sake of escaping punishment! No, no.
I just want a chance to&ndash;&ndash;to expiate the evil I have done. I
want to do some good to undo all the bad I&rsquo;ve brought about.
I won&rsquo;t try to shift any blame. I want to confess. It will
take this awful load off my heart to tell people what a wicked
fool I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder checked her: &ldquo;But that is just what you must
not do. Unless you can assure us that you will carry this
burden about with you and keep it secret at no matter what
cost, then we shall have to proceed with the case&ndash;&ndash;legally.
We shall have to exhume Sir Joseph and Lady Webling, as
it were, and drag the whole thing through the courts. We&rsquo;d
really rather not, but if you insist&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll promise. I&rsquo;ll keep the secret. Let them rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was driven less by the thought of her own liberty
than the terror of exposing the dead. The mere thought
brought back pictures of hideous days when the grave was
not refuge enough from vengeance, when bodies were dug up,
gibbeted, haled by a chain along the unwashed cobblestones,
quartered with a sword in the market-place and then flung
back to the dark.</p>
<p>Verrinder may have feared that Marie Louise yielded under
duress, and that when she was out of reach of the law she
would forget, so he said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you swear to keep this inviolate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought there must be one, and she searched for it
among the bookshelves. But first she came across one in
the German tongue. It fell open easily, as if it had been a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
familiar companion of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s. She abhorred the sight
of the words that youthful Sunday-school lessons had given
an unearthly sanctity as she recognized them twisted into the
German paraphrase and printed in the twisted German type.
But she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will this do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verrinder shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that an oath
on a German Bible would really count. It might be considered
a mere heap of paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise put it aside and brushed its dust off her
fingers. She found an English Bible after a further search.
Its pages had seen the light but seldom. It slipped from
her hand and fell open. She knelt to pick it up with a tremor
of fear.</p>
<p>She rose, and before she closed it glanced at the page
before her. These words caught her eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me. Take the winecup
of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send
thee, to drink it. And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad
because of the sword that I will send among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She showed them to Verrinder. He nodded solemnly,
took the book from her hand, closed it, and held it before her.
She put the slim tips of her young fingers near the talon of his
old thumb and echoed in a timid, silvern voice the broken
phrases he spoke in a tone of bronze:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I solemnly swear&ndash;&ndash;that so long as I live&ndash;&ndash;I will tell no
one&ndash;&ndash;what I know&ndash;&ndash;of the crimes and death&ndash;&ndash;of Sir Joseph
and Lady Webling&ndash;&ndash;unless called upon&ndash;&ndash;in a court of law.
This oath is made&ndash;&ndash;with no mental reservations&ndash;&ndash;and is
binding&ndash;&ndash;under all circumstances whatsoever&ndash;&ndash;so help me
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had whispered the last invocation he put the
book away and gripped her hand in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must remind you that releasing you is highly illegal&ndash;&ndash;and
perhaps immoral. Our action might be overruled and the
whole case opened. But I think you are safe, especially if
you get to America&ndash;&ndash;the sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He laughed, somewhat pathetically.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not tell her that England would still be watching
over her, that her name and her history were already cabled
to America, that she would be shadowed to the steamer,
observed aboard the boat, and picked up at the dock by the
first of a long series of detectives constituting a sort of serial
guardian angel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Leaving England quickly was not easy in those days.
Passenger-steamers were few, irregular, and secret. The
passport regulations were exceedingly rigorous, and even Mr.
Verrinder&rsquo;s influence could not speed the matter greatly.</p>
<p>There was the Webling estate to settle up, also. At Verrinder&rsquo;s
suggestion Marie Louise put her affairs into the hands
of counsel, and he arranged her surrender of all claims on the
Webling estate. But he insisted that she should keep the
twenty thousand pounds that had been given to her absolutely.
He may have been influenced in this by his inability to see
from what other funds he could collect his fee.</p>
<p>Eventually he placed her aboard a liner, and her bonds in the
purser&rsquo;s safe; and eventually the liner stole out into the ocean,
through such a gantlet of lurking demons as old superstitions
peopled it with.</p>
<p>She had not told the children good-by, but had delivered
them to the Oakbys and run away. The Oakbys had received
her with a coldness that startled her. They used the expression,
&ldquo;Under the circumstances,&rdquo; with a freezing implication
that made her wonder if the secret had already trickled
through to them.</p>
<p>On the steamer there was nobody she knew. At the dock
no friends greeted her. She did not notice that her arrival
was noted by a certain Mr. Larrey, who had been detailed to
watch her and saw with some pride how pretty she was.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a pleasure to keep an eye on her,&rdquo; he told a luckless
colleague who had a long-haired pacifist professor allotted to
him. But Marie Louise&rsquo;s mystic squire had not counted on
her stopping in New York for only a day and then setting
forth on a long, hot, stupid train-ride of two days to the
little town of her birth, Wakefield.</p>
<p>Larrey found it appalling. Marie Louise found it far smaller
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and shabbier than she had imagined. Yet it had grown some,
too, since her time.</p>
<p>At least, most of the people she had known had moved away
to the cities or the cemeteries, and new people had taken their
place. She had not known many of the better people. Her
mother had been too humble to sew for them.</p>
<p>Coming from London and the country life of England, she
found the town intolerably ugly. It held no associations for
her. She had been unhappy there, and she said: &ldquo;Poor me!
No wonder I ran away.&rdquo; She justified her earlier self with
a kind of mothering sympathy. She longed for some one to
mother her present self.</p>
<p>But her sister was not to be found. The old house where
they had lived was replaced by a factory that had made
suspenders and now was turning out cartridge-belts. She
found no one who knew her sister at all. She did not
give her own name, for many reasons, and her face was not
remembered. A few people recalled the family. The town
marshal vaguely placed her father as a frequent boarder at the
jail.</p>
<p>One sweet old lady, for whom Marie Louise&rsquo;s mother had
done sewing, had a kind of notion that one of the sisters had
run away and that the other sister had left town with somebody
for somewhere sometime after. But that was all that the
cupboard of her recollection disclosed.</p>
<p>Anatole France has a short story of Pilate in his old age
meeting his predecessor as Proconsul in Jerusalem. During
their senile gossip the elder asks if Pilate had known a certain
beauty named Mary of Magdala. Pilate shakes his head.
The other has heard that she took up with a street-preacher
called Jesus from the town of Nazareth. Pilate ponders,
shakes his head again, and confesses, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not strange, then, that Marie Louise&rsquo;s people, who
had made almost no impression on the life of the town, should
have lapsed from its memory. But it was discouraging.
Marie Louise felt as much of an anachronism as old Rip Van
Winkle, though she looked no more like him than an exquisite,
fashionable young woman could look like a gray-bearded sot
who has slept in his clothes for twenty years.</p>
<p>Her private detective, Larrey, homesick for New York,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
was overjoyed when she went back, but she was disconsolate
and utterly detached from life. The prodigal had come home,
but the family had moved away.</p>
<p>She took a comfortable little nook in an apartment hotel
and settled down to meditate. The shops interested her,
and she browsed away among them for furniture and clothes
and books.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had not been in her homeless home long when
the President visited Congress and asked it to declare a state
of war against Germany. She was exultant over the great
step, but the wilful few who held Congress back from answering
the summons revealed to her why the nation had been
so slow in responding to the crisis. Even now, after so much
insult and outrage, vast numbers of Americans denied that
there was any cause for war.</p>
<p>But the patience of the majority had been worn thin.
The opposition was swept away, and America declared herself
in the arena&ndash;&ndash;in spirit at least. Impatient souls who had
prophesied how the millions would spring to arms overnight
wondered at the failure to commit a miracle. The
Germans, who had prepared for forty years, laughed at the
new enemy and felt guaranteed by five impossibilities: that
America should raise a real army, or equip it, or know how to
train it, or be able to get it past the submarine barrier, or
feed the few that might sneak through.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s vast resources were unready, unwieldy, unknown.
The first embarrassment was the panic of volunteers.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was only one of the hundred million who sprang
madly in all directions and landed nowhere. She wanted to
volunteer, too, but for what? What could she do? Where
could she get it to do? In the chaos of her impatience she
did nothing.</p>
<p>Supping alone at the Biltmore one night, she was seen,
hailed, and seized by Polly Widdicombe. Marie Louise&rsquo;s detective
knew who Polly was. He groaned to note that she
was the first friend his client had found.</p>
<p>Polly, giggling adorably, embraced her and kissed her
before everybody in the big Tudor Room. And Polly&rsquo;s husband
greeted her with warmth of hand and voice.</p>
<p>Marie Louise almost wept, almost cried aloud with joy.
The prodigal was home, had been welcomed with a kiss.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Evidently her secret had not crossed the ocean. She could
take up life again. Some day the past would confront and
denounce her, perhaps; but for the moment she was enfranchised
anew of human society.</p>
<p>Polly said that she had read of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s death and his
wife&rsquo;s, and what a shock it must have been to poor Marie
Louise, but how well she bore up under it, and how perfectly
darn beautiful she was, and what a shame that it was almost
midnight! She and her hub were going to Washington.
Everybody was, of course. Why wasn&rsquo;t Marie Louise there?
And Polly&rsquo;s husband was to be a major&ndash;&ndash;think of it! He was
going to be all dolled up in olive drab and things and&ndash;&ndash; &ldquo;Damn
the clock, anyway; if we miss that train we can&rsquo;t
get on another for days. And what&rsquo;s your address? Write
it on the edge of that bill of fare and tear it off, and I&rsquo;ll write
you the minute I get settled, for you must come to us and nowhere
else and&ndash;&ndash; Good-by, darling child, and&ndash;&ndash; All right,
Tom, I&rsquo;m coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she was gone.</p>
<p>Marie Louise went back to her seclusion much happier
and yet much lonelier. She had found a friend who had not
heard of her disgrace. She had lost a friend who still rejoiced
to see her.</p>
<p>But her faithful watchman was completely discouraged.
When he turned in his report he threatened to turn in his
resignation unless he were relieved of the futile task of recording
Marie Louise&rsquo;s blameless and eventless life.</p>
<p>And then the agent&rsquo;s night was turned to day&ndash;&ndash;at least his
high noon was turned to higher. For a few days later Marie
Louise was abruptly addressed by Nicky Easton.</p>
<p>She had been working in the big Red Cross shop on Fifth
Avenue, rolling bandages and making dressings with a crowd
of other white-fingered women. A cable had come that there
was a sudden need for at least ten thousand bandages. These
were not yet for American soldiers in France, though their
turn would come, and their wholesale need. But as Marie
Louise wrought she could imagine the shattered flesh, the
crying nerves of some poor patriot whose gaping wound this
linen pack would smother. And her own nerves cried out in
vicarious crucifixion. At noon she left the factory for a little
air and a bite of lunch.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>Nicky Easton appeared out of her list of the buried. She
gasped at sight of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed: &ldquo;If I am it, thees is my <i>Doppelg&auml;nger</i>.&rdquo; And
he began to hum with a grisly smile Schubert&rsquo;s setting to
Heine&rsquo;s poem of the man who met his own ghost and double,
aping his love-sorrow outside the home of his dead sweetheart:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;<i>Der Mond zeigt mir meine eig&rsquo;ne Gestalt.<br />
Du Doppelg&auml;nger, du bleicher Geselle!<br />
Was &auml;ffst du nach mein Liebesleid,<br />
Das mich gequ&auml;lt auf dieser Stelle<br />
So manche Nacht in alter Zeit.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Marie Louise was terrified by the harrowing emotions the
song always roused in her, but more by the dreadful sensation
of walking that crowded Avenue with a man humming German
at her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush, in Heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>He laughed Teutonically, and asked her to lunch with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have another engagement, and I am late,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt inspired to give him a false address. He insisted
on walking with her to the Waldorf, where she said her
engagement was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask me where I have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to. The last I heard you were in the
London Tower or somewhere. However did you get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same way like you ditt. I thought you should choin
me therein, but you also told all you knew and some more
yet, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw then that he had turned state&rsquo;s evidence. Perhaps
he had betrayed Sir Joseph. Somehow she found it possible
to loathe him extra. She lacked the strength to deny his
odious insinuation about herself. He went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am in America. I could not dare go to Germany
now. But here I try to gain back my place in <i>Deutschland</i>.
These English think they use me for a stool-pitcheon. But
they will find out, and when <i>Deutschland ist &uuml;ber alles&ndash;&ndash;ach,
Gott</i>! You shall help me. We do some work togedder. I
come soon by your house. <i>Auf</i>&ndash;&ndash;Goot-py.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>He left her at the hotel door and lifted his hat. She went
into the labyrinth and lost herself. When her heart had
ceased fluttering and she grew calm from very fatigue of
alarm she resolved to steal out of New York.</p>
<p>She spent an afternoon and an evening of indecision.
Night brought counsel. Polly Widdicombe had offered her a
haven, and in the country. It would be an ideal hiding-place.
She set to work at midnight packing her trunk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>Marie Louise tried all the next morning to telephone
from New York to Washington, but it seemed that
everybody on earth was making the same effort. It was a wire
Babel.</p>
<p>Washington was suddenly America in the same way that
London had long been England; and Paris France. The
entire population was apparently trying to get into Washington
in order to get out again. People wrote, telegraphed,
radiographed, telephoned, and traveled thither by all the
rail- and motor-roads. Washington was the narrow neck of
the funnel leading to the war, and the sleepy old home of
debate and administration was suddenly dumfounded to find
itself treated to all the horrors of a boom-town&ndash;&ndash;it was like
San Francisco in &rsquo;49.</p>
<p>Marie Louise, who had not yet recovered her American
dialect, kept pleading with Long Distance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, cahn&rsquo;t you put me through to Washington?
It&rsquo;s no end important, really! Rosslyn, seven three one two.
I want to speak to Mrs. Widdicombe. I am Miss Webling.
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The obliging central asked her telephone number and
promised to call her in a moment. Eternity is but a moment&ndash;&ndash;to
some centrals. Marie Louise, being finite and ephemeral,
never heard from that central again. Later she took up the
receiver and got another central, who had never heard her tale
of woe and had to have it all over again. This central also
asked her name and number and promised to report, then
vanished into the interstellar limbo where busy centrals go.</p>
<p>Again and again Marie Louise waited and called, and told
and retold her prayer till it turned to gibberish and she began
to doubt her own name and to mix the telephone number
hopelessly. Then she went into her hand-bag and pawed
about in the little pocket edition of confusion till she found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the note that Polly had sent her at once from Washington
with the address, Grinden Hall, Rosslyn, and the telephone
number and the message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So glad you&rsquo;re on this side of the water, dear. Do run over and
see us. Perfect barn of a house, and lost in the country, but there&rsquo;s
always room&ndash;&ndash;especially for you, dear. You&rsquo;ll never get in at a hotel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marie Louise propped this against the telephone and tried
again.</p>
<p>The seventh central dazed her with, &ldquo;We can take nothing
but gov&rsquo;ment business till two <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise rose in despair, searched in her bag for her
watch, gasped, put the watch and the note back in her bag,
snapped it, and rose to go.</p>
<p>She decided to send Polly a telegram. She took out the
note for the address and telephoned a telegram, saying that
she would arrive at five o&rsquo;clock. The telegraph-operator told
her that the company could not guarantee delivery, as traffic
over the wires was very heavy. Marie Louise sighed and
rose, worn out with telephone-fag.</p>
<p>She told the maid to ask the hall-boy to get her a taxi,
and hastily made ready to leave. Her trunks had gone to the
station an hour ago, and they had been checked through from
the house.</p>
<p>Her final pick-up glance about the room did not pick
up the note she had propped on the telephone-table. She
left it there and closed the door on another chapter of her life.</p>
<p>She rode to the station, and, after standing in line for a
weary while, learned that not a seat was to be had in a parlor-car
to-day, to-morrow, or any day for two weeks. Berths
at night were still more unobtainable.</p>
<p>She decided that she might as well go in a day-coach.
Scores of people had had the same idea before her. The day-coaches
were filled. She sidled through the crowded aisles
and found no seat. She invaded the chair-cars in desperation.</p>
<p>In one of these she saw a porter bestowing hand-luggage.
She appealed to him. &ldquo;You must have one chair left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was hardly polite in his answer. &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I ain&rsquo;t.
I ain&rsquo;t a single chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to sit somewhere,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>The porter did not comment on such a patent fallacy. He
moved back to the front to repel boarders. Several men stared
from the depths of their dentist&rsquo;s chairs, but made no proffer
of their seats. They believed that woman&rsquo;s newfangled
equality included the privilege of standing up.</p>
<p>One man, however, gave a start as of recognition, real or
pretended. Marie Louise did not know him, and said so with
her eyes. His smile of recognition changed to a smile of
courtesy. He proffered her his seat with an old-fashioned
gesture. She declined with a shake of the head and a coldly
correct smile.</p>
<p>He insisted academically, as much as to say: &ldquo;I can see
that you are a gentlewoman. Please accept me as a gentleman
and permit me to do my duty.&rdquo; There was a brief, silent
tug-of-war between his unselfishness and hers. He won.
Before she realized it, she had dropped wearily into his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where will you sit?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll get along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled and moved off, lugging his suit-case. He had the
air of one who would get along. He had shown himself masterful
in two combats, and compelled her to take the chair he
had doubtless engaged with futile providence days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rahthah a decentish chap, with a will of his own,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>The train started, left the station twilight, plunged into the
tunnel of gloom and made the dip under the Hudson River.
People felt their ears buzz and smother. Wise ones swallowed
hard. The train came back to the surface and the sunlight,
and ran across New Jersey.</p>
<p>Marie Louise decided to take her luncheon early, to make
sure of it. Nearly everybody else had decided to do the same
thing. At this time all the people in America seemed to be
thinking <i>en masse</i>. When she reached the dining-car every
seat was taken and there was a long bread-line in the narrow
corridor.</p>
<p>The wilful man was at the head. He fished for her eye,
caught it, and motioned to her to take his place. She shook her
head. But it seemed to do no good to shake heads at him;
he came down the corridor and lifted his hat. His voice and
words were pleading, but his tone was imperative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>She shook her head, but he still held his hand out, pointing.
She was angry at being bossed even for her own benefit.
Worse yet, by the time she got to the head of the line the
second man had moved up to first. He stared at her as if he
wondered what she was doing there. She fell back, doubly
vexed, but That Man advanced and gave the interloper a
look like a policeman&rsquo;s shove. The fellow backed up on the
next man&rsquo;s toes. Then the cavalier smiled Miss Webling to
her place and went back to the foot of the class without waiting
for her furious thanks.</p>
<p>She wanted to stamp her foot. She had always hated to
be cowed or compelled to take chairs or money. People who
had tried to move her soul or lend her their experience or their
advantages had always aroused resentment.</p>
<p>Before long she had a seat. The man opposite her was just
thumbing his last morsel of pie. She supposed that when he
left That Man would take the chair and order her luncheon
for her. But it was not so to be. She passed him still well
down the line. He had probably given his place to other
women in succession. She did not like that. It seemed a trifle
unfaithful or promiscuous or something. The rescuer owes the
rescuee a certain fidelity. He did not look at her. He did not
claim even a glance of gratitude.</p>
<p>It was so American a gallantry that she resented it. If he
had seemed to ask for the alms of a smile, she would have
insulted him. Yet it was not altogether satisfactory to be
denied the privilege. She fumed. Everything was wrong. She
sat in her cuckoo&rsquo;s nest and glared at the reeling landscape.</p>
<p>Suddenly she began pawing through that private chaos,
looking for Polly Widdicombe&rsquo;s letter. She could not find it.
She found the checks for her trunks, a handkerchief, a pair of
gloves, and various other things, but not the letter. This gave
her a new fright.</p>
<p>She remembered now that she had left it on the telephone-table.
She could see it plainly as her remembered glance took
its last survey of the room. The brain has a way of developing
occasional photographs very slowly. Something strikes our
eyes, and we do not really see it till long after. We hear words
and say, &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; and hear
them again before they can be repeated.</p>
<p>This belated feat of memory encouraged Miss Webling to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
hope that she could remember a little farther back to the contents
of the letter and the telephone number written there.
But her memory would not respond. The effort to cudgel it
seemed to confuse it. She kept on forgetting more and more
completely.</p>
<p>All she could remember was what Polly Widdicombe had
said about there being no chance to get into a hotel&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;an
h&ocirc;tel,&rdquo; Marie Louise still thought it.</p>
<p>It grew more and more evident that the train would be hours
late. People began to worry audibly about the hotels that
would probably refuse them admission. At length they began
to stroll toward the dining-car for an early dinner.</p>
<p>Marie Louise, to make sure of the meal and for lack of
other employment, went along. There was no queue in
the corridor now. She did not have to take That Man&rsquo;s
place. She found one at a little empty table. But by and
by he appeared, and, though there were other vacant seats,
he sat down opposite her.</p>
<p>She could hardly order the conductor to eject him. In
fact, seeing that she owed him for her seat&ndash;&ndash; It suddenly smote
her that he must have paid for it. She owed him money!
This was unendurable!</p>
<p>He made no attempt to speak to her, but at length she
found courage to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up and about for the salt or something to pass,
but she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask you how much you paid for the seat you gave
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed outright at this unexpected demand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t remember, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you must, and you must let me repay it. It
just occurred to me that I had cheated you out of your chair,
and your money, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty kind of you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He laughed again, but rather tenderly, and she was grateful
to him for having the tact not to be flamboyant about it
and not insisting on forgetting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember just how much it was in a minute, and if
you will feel easier about it, I&rsquo;ll ask you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could hardly rob a perfect stranger,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>He broke in: &ldquo;They say nobody is perfect, and I&rsquo;m not a
perfect stranger. I&rsquo;ve met you before, Miss Webling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not rilly! Wherever was it? I&rsquo;m so stupid not to remember&ndash;&ndash;even
your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rather liked her for not bluffing it through. He could
understand her haziness the better from the fact that when
he first saw her in the chair-car and leaped to his feet it was
because he had identified her once more with the long-lost, long-sought
beauty of years long gone&ndash;&ndash;the girl he had seen in the
cheap vaudeville theater. This slip of memory had uncovered
another memory. He had corrected the palimpsest
and recalled her as the Miss Webling whom he had met in
London. She had given him the same start then as now, and,
as he recalled it, she had snubbed him rather vigorously.
So he had kept his distance. But the proffer of the money
for the chair-car chair broke the ice a little. He said at last:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Ross Davidge. I met you at your father&rsquo;s
house in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to agitate her peculiarly. She trembled and
gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it. I&ndash;&ndash; Oh yes, of course I remember&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t lie about it,&rdquo; he pleaded, bluntly, &ldquo;for of
course you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, but very nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we did give very large dinners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very large one the night I was there. I was a
mile down the street from you, and I said nothing immortal.
I was only a business acquaintance of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s, anyway.
It was about ships, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw that her mind was far away and under strange
excitation. But she murmured, distantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you are&ndash;&ndash;interested in ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make &rsquo;em for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly! How interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This constraint was irksome. He ventured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the old boy? Sir Joseph, I mean. He&rsquo;s well, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know? Didn&rsquo;t you read
in the papers&ndash;&ndash;about their death together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theirs? His wife and he died together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In a submarine attack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, at home. It was in all the papers&ndash;&ndash;about their dying
on the same night, from&ndash;&ndash;from ptomaine poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put a vast amount of shock and regret in the mumbled
word. He explained: &ldquo;I must have been out in the forest
or in the mines at the time. Forgive me for opening the
old wound. How long ago was it? I see you&rsquo;re out of
mourning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Joseph abominated black; and besides, few people wear
mourning in England during the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Poor old England! You poor Englishwomen&ndash;&ndash;mothers
and daughters! My God! what you&rsquo;ve gone
through! And such pluck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he realized what he was doing his hand went across
and touched hers, and he clenched it for just a moment of
fierce sympathy. She did not resent the message. Then he
muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it means. I lost my father and mother&ndash;&ndash;not
at once, of course&ndash;&ndash;years apart. But to lose them both in
one night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a sharp attempt at self-control:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please! I beg you&ndash;&ndash;please don&rsquo;t speak of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so sorry that he said nothing more. Marie Louise
was doubly fascinating to him because she was in sorrow and
afraid of something or somebody. Besides, she was inaccessible,
and Ross Davidge always felt a challenge from the
impossible and the inaccessible.</p>
<p>She called for her check and paid it, and tipped the waiter
and rose. She smiled wretchedly at him as he rose with her.
She left the dining-car, and he sat down and cursed himself
for a brute and a blunderer.</p>
<p>He kept in the offing, so that if she wanted him she could
call him, but he thought it the politer politeness not to italicize
his chivalry. He was so distressed that he forgot that she had
forgotten to pay him for the chair.</p>
<p>It was good and dark when the train pulled into Washington
at last. The dark gave Marie Louise another reason for dismay.
The appearance of a man who had dined at Sir Joseph&rsquo;s,
and the necessity for telling him the lie about that death,
had brought on a crisis of nerves. She was afraid of the dark,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
but more afraid of the man who might ask still more questions.
She avoided him purposely when she left the train.</p>
<p>A porter took her hand-baggage and led her to the taxi-stand.
Polly Widdicombe&rsquo;s car was not waiting. Marie
Louise went to the front of the building to see if she might
be there. She was appalled at the thought of Polly&rsquo;s not
meeting her. She needed her blessed giggle as never before.</p>
<p>It was a very majestic station. Marie Louise had heard
people say that it was much too majestic for a railroad
station. As if America did not owe more to the iron god
of the rails than to any of her other deities!</p>
<p>Before her was the Capitol, lighted from below, its dome
floating cloudily above the white parapets as if mystically
sustained. The superb beauty of it clutched her throat.
She wanted to do something for it and all the holy ideals it
symbolized.</p>
<p>Evidently Polly was not coming. The telegram had probably
never reached her. The porter asked her, &ldquo;Was you
thinkin&rsquo; of a taxi?&rdquo; and she said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; only to realize
that she had no address to give the driver.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>She went through her hand-bag again, while the porter
computed how many tips he was missing and the cab-starter
looked insufferable things about womankind.</p>
<p>She asked if any of them knew where Grinden Hall might
be, but they shook their heads. She had a sudden happy
idea. She would ask the telephone Information for the
number. She hurried to a booth, followed by the despondent
porter. She asked for Information and got her, but that
was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please give me the numba of Mrs. Widdicombe&rsquo;s, in
Rosslyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Washington dialect eventually told her that the number
was a private wire and could not be given.</p>
<p>Marie Louise implored a special dispensation, but it was
against the rules.</p>
<p>She asked for the supervisor&ndash;&ndash;who was equally sorry and
adamant. Marie Louise left the booth in utter defeat.
There was nothing to do but go to a hotel till the morrow.</p>
<p>She recalled the stories of the hopelessness of getting a room.
Yet she had no choice but to make the try. She had got a
seat on the train where there were none. Perhaps she could
trust her luck to provide her with a lodging, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go back to the taxi-stand,&rdquo; she told the porter.</p>
<p>He did not conceal his joy at being rid of her.</p>
<p>She tried the Shoreham first, and when the taxicab deposited
her under the umbrellas of the big trees and she climbed the
homelike steps to a lobby with the air of a living-room she
felt welcome and secure. Brilliant clusters were drifting to
dinner, and the men were more picturesque than the women,
for many of them were in uniform. Officers of the army and
navy of the United States and of Great Britain and of France
gave the throng the look of a costume-party.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>There was a less interesting crowd at the desk, and now
nobody offered her his place at the head of the line. It
would have done no good, for the room-clerk was shaking
his head to all the suppliants. Marie Louise saw women
turned away, married couples, men alone. But new-comers
pressed forward and kept trying to convince the deskman
that he had rooms somewhere, rooms that he had forgotten,
or was saving for people who would never arrive.</p>
<p>He stood there shaking his head like a toy in a window.
People tried to get past him in all the ways people try to
get through life, in the ways that Saint Peter must grow
very tired of at the gate of heaven&ndash;&ndash;bluff, whine, bribery,
intimidation, flirtation.</p>
<p>Some demanded their rights with full confidence and would
not take no for answer. Some pleaded with hopelessness in
advance; they were used to rebuffs. They appealed to his
pity. Some tried corruption; they whispered that they
would &ldquo;make it all right,&rdquo; or they managed a sly display
of money&ndash;&ndash;one a one-dollar bill with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; folded in,
another a fifty-dollar bill with the &ldquo;50&rdquo; well to the fore.
Some grew ugly and implied favoritism; they were the
born strikers and anarchists. Even though they looked
rich, they had that habit of finding oppression and conspiracy
everywhere. A few women appealed to his philanthropy,
and a few others tried to play the siren. But
his head oscillated from side to side, and nobody could
swing it up and down.</p>
<p>Marie Louise watched the procession anxiously. There
seemed to be no end to it. The people who had come here
first had been turned away into outer darkness long ago
and had gone to other hotels. The present wretches were
those who had gone to the other hotels first and made this
their second, third, or sixth choice.</p>
<p>Marie Louise did not go to the desk. She could take
a hint at second hand. She would have been glad of a
place to sit down, but all the divans were filled with
gossipers very much at home and somewhat contemptuous
of the vulgar herd trying to break into their select and
long-established circle. She heard a man saying, with amiable
anger: &ldquo;Ah&rsquo;m mahty sah&rsquo;y Ah can&rsquo;t put you up at
ouah haouse, but we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em hangin&rsquo; on the hat-rack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
in the hall. You infunnal patriots have simply ruined this
little old taown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard a pleasant laugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll get along
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced aside and saw That Man again. She had forgotten
his name again; yet she felt curiously less lonely, not
nearly so hopeless. The other man said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Davidge, are you daown heah looking for one of these
dollah-a-yeah jobs? Can you earn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for a job. I&rsquo;m looking for a bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance. The government&rsquo;s taken ovah half the
hotels for office-buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to a Turkish bath, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lawd! man, I hud a man propose that, and the
hotel clerk said he had telephoned the Tukkish bath, and a
man theah said: &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t send anybody else
heah! We&rsquo;ve got five hundred cots full naow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baltimer&rsquo;s full up. So&rsquo;s Alexandra. Go on back home
and write a letta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try a few more hotels first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use&ndash;&ndash;not an openin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve usually found that the best place to look
for things is where people say they don&rsquo;t grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise thought that this was most excellent advice.
She decided to follow it and keep on trying.</p>
<p>As she was about to move toward the door the elevator,
like a great cornucopia, spilled a bevy of men and women
into the lobby. Leading them all came a woman of charm,
of distinction, of self-possession. She was smiling over one
handsome shoulder at a British officer.</p>
<p>The forlorn Marie Louise saw her, and her eyes rejoiced;
her face was kindled with haven-beacons. She pressed forward
with her hand out, and though she only murmured the
words, a cry of relief thrilled them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clifton-Wyatt! What luck to find you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt turned with a smile of welcome in
advance. Her hand went forward. Her smile ended suddenly.
Blank amazement passed into contemptuous wrath. Her
hand went back. With the disgust of a sick eagle in a zoo,
she drew a film over her eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>The smile on Marie Louise&rsquo;s face also hung unsupported for
a moment. It faded, then rallied. She spoke with patience,
underlining the words with an affectionate reproof:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Lady Clifton-Wyatt, I am Miss Webling&ndash;&ndash;Marie
Louise. Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt answered: &ldquo;I did. But I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned and moved toward the dining-room door.</p>
<p>The head waiter bowed with deference and command and
beckoned Lady Clifton-Wyatt. She obeyed him with meek
hauteur.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>As she came out of the first hotel of her selection and
rejection Marie Louise asked the car-starter the name
of another. He mentioned the New Willard.</p>
<p>It was not far, and she was there before she had time to
recover from the staggering effect of Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s
bludgeon-like snub. As timidly as the waif and estray that
she was, she ventured into the crowded, gorgeous lobby
with its lofty and ornate ceiling on its big columns. At
one side a long corridor ran brokenly up a steep hill. It
was populous with loungers who had just finished their dinners
or were waiting for a chance to get into the dining-rooms.
Orchestra music was lilting down the aisle.</p>
<p>When Marie Louise had threaded the crowd and reached
the desk a very polite and eager clerk asked her if she had
a reservation. He seemed to be as regretful as she when she
said no. He sighed, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve turned away a hundred people
in the last two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She accepted her dismissal dumbly, then paused to ask,
&ldquo;I say, do you by any chance know where Grinden Hall is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head and turned to another clerk to ask,
&ldquo;Do you know of a hotel here named Grinden Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other shook his head, too. There was a vast amount
of head-shaking going on everywhere in Washington. He
added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m new here.&rdquo; Nearly everybody seemed to be
new here. It seemed as if the entire populace had moved
into a ready-made town.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had barely the strength to explain, &ldquo;Grinden
Hall is not an hotel; it is a home, in Rosslyn, wherever that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rosslyn&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s across the river in Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, by any chance, Major Thomas Widdicombe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. Major Widdicombe was a big man,
but the town was fairly swarming with men bigger than he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
There were shoals of magnates, but giants in their own communities
were petty nuisances here pleading with room-clerks
for cots and with head waiters for bread. The lobby
was a thicket of prominent men set about like trees. Several
of them had the Congressional look. Later history
would record them as the historic statesmen of titanic debates,
men by whose eloquence and leadership and committee-room
toil the Republic would be revolutionized in nearly every
detail, and billions made to flow like water.</p>
<p>As Marie Louise collected her porter and her hand-luggage
for her next exit she saw Ross Davidge just coming in.
She stepped behind a large politician or something. She
forgot that she owed Davidge money, and she felt a rather
pleasurable agitation in this game of hide-and-seek, but
something made her shy of Davidge. For one thing, it was
ludicrous to be caught being turned out of a second hotel.</p>
<p>The politician walked away, and Davidge would have seen
Marie Louise if he had not stopped short and turned a cold
shoulder on her, just as the distant orchestra, which had been
crooning one of Jerome Kern&rsquo;s most insidiously ingratiating
melodies, began to blare with all its might the sonorities of
&ldquo;The Star-spangled Banner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Webling saw the people in the alley getting to their
feet slowly, awkwardly. A number of army and navy officers
faced the music and stood rigid at attention. The
civilians in the lobby who were already standing began to
pull their hats off sheepishly like embarrassed peasants.
People were still as self-conscious as if the song had just
been written. They would soon learn to feel the tremendous
importance of that eternal query, the only national anthem,
perhaps, that ever began with a question and ended with a
prayer. Americans would soon learn to salute it with eagerness
and to deal ferociously with men&ndash;&ndash;and women, too&ndash;&ndash;who
were slow to rise.</p>
<p>Marie Louise watched Davidge curiously. He was manifestly
on fire with patriotism, but he was ashamed to show
it, ashamed to stand erect and click his heels. He fumbled
his hat and slouched, and looked as if he had been caught
in some guilt. He was indeed guilty of a childish fervor.
He wanted to shout, he wanted to weep, he wanted to fight
somebody; but he did not know how to express himself without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
striking an attitude, and he was incapable of being a
<i>poseur</i>&ndash;&ndash;except as an American posily affects poselessness.</p>
<p>When the anthem ended, people sank into their chairs
with sighs of relief; the officers sharply relaxed; the civilians
straightened up and felt at home again. Ross Davidge
marched to the desk, not noticing Marie Louise, who motioned
to her porter to come along with her luggage and went
to hunt shelter at the Raleigh Hotel. She kept her taxi
now and left her hand-baggage in it while she received the
inevitable rebuff. From there she traveled to hotel after
hotel, marching in with the dismal assurance that she would
march right out again.</p>
<p>The taxi-driver was willing to take her to hotels as long
as they and her money lasted. Her strength and her patience
gave out first. At the Lafayette she advanced wearily,
disconsolately to the desk. She saw Ross Davidge stretched
out in a big chair. He did not see her. His hat was pulled
over his eyes, and he had the air of angry failure. If he
despaired, what chance had she?</p>
<p>She received the usual regrets from the clerk. As she left
the desk the floor began to wabble. She hurried to an inviting
divan and dropped down, beaten and distraught. She heard
some one approach, and her downcast eyes saw a pair of feet
move up and halt before her.</p>
<p>Since Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s searing glance and words Marie
Louise had felt branded visibly, and unworthy of human
kindness and shelter. She was piteously grateful to this man
for his condescension in saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me for bothering you again. But
I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re in worse trouble than I am. Nobody
seems to be willing to take you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He meant this as a light jocularity, but it gave her a moment&rsquo;s
serious fear that he had overheard Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s
slashing remark. But he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you allow me to try to find you a place? Don&rsquo;t
you know anybody here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know numbers of people, but I don&rsquo;t know where any
of them are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him of her efforts to get to Rosslyn by telephone,
by telegraph, by train or taxicab. Little tears added a sparkle
to laughter, but threatened rain. She ended with, &ldquo;And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
now that I&rsquo;ve unloaded my riddles on you, aren&rsquo;t you sorry
you spoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said, with a subtle compliment pleasantly
implying that she was perilous. Everybody likes to be thought
perilous. He went on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Rosslyn, but it can&rsquo;t
be much of a place for size. If you have a friend there, we&rsquo;ll
find her if we have to go to every house in Rosslyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s getting rather late, isn&rsquo;t it, to be knocking at all
the doors all by myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not meant to hint, and it was a mere coincidence
that he thought to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but it&rsquo;s out in the country rather far, I&rsquo;m
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of troubling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end of it was that he had his way, or she hers, or
both theirs. He made no nonsense of adventure or escapade
about it, and she was too well used to traveling alone
to feel ashamed or alarmed. He led her to the taxi, told
the driver that Grinden Hall was their objective and must be
found. Then he climbed in with her, and they rode in a dark
broken with the fitful lightnings of street-lamps and motors.</p>
<p>The taxi glided out M Street. The little shops of Georgetown
went sidelong by. The cab turned abruptly to the left
and clattered across the old aqueduct bridge. On a broad
reach of the Potomac the new-risen moon spread a vast sheet
of tin-foil of a crinkled sheen. This was all that was beautiful
about the sordid neighborhood, but it was very beautiful,
and tender to a strange degree.</p>
<p>Once across, the driver stopped and leaned round to call
in at the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Rosslyn. Where do yew-all want to go next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grinden Hall. Ask somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask who? They ain&rsquo;t a soul tew be saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited in the dark awhile; then Davidge got out
and, seeing a street-car coming down through the hills like
a dragon in fiery scales, he stopped it to ask the motorman
of Grinden Hall. He knew nothing, but a sleepy passenger
said that he reckoned that that was the fancy name of Mr.
Sawtell&rsquo;s place, and he shouted the directions:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yew go raht along this road ovah the caw tracks, and
unda a bridge and keep a-goin&rsquo; up a ridge and ova till yew
come to a shawp tu&rsquo;n to the raht. Big whaht mansion,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;I never saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon that&rsquo;s the place. Only &lsquo;Hall&rsquo; I knaow
about up heah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motorman kicked his bell and started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like trying,&rdquo; said Davidge, and clambered in.
The taxicab went veering and yawing over an unusually
Virginian bad road. After a little they entered a forest. The
driver threw on his search-light, and it tore from the darkness
pictures of forest eerily green in the glare&ndash;&ndash;old trees slanting
out, deep channels blackening into mysterious glades. The
car swung sharply to the right and growled up a hill, curving
and swirling and threatening to capsize at every moment.
The sense of being lost was irresistible.</p>
<p>Marie Louise fell to pondering; suddenly she grew afraid
to find Grinden Hall. She knew that Polly knew Lady Clifton-Wyatt.
They might have met since Polly wrote that letter.
Lady Clifton-Wyatt had perhaps&ndash;&ndash;had doubtless&ndash;&ndash;told Polly
all about Marie Louise. Polly would probably refuse her
shelter. She knew Polly: there was no middle ground between
her likes and dislikes; she doted or she hated. She
was capable of smothering her friends with affection and of
making them ancient enemies in an instant. For her enemies
she had no use or tolerance. She let them know her wrath.</p>
<p>The car stopped. The driver got down and went forward
to a narrow lane opening from the narrow road. There was
a sign-board there. He read it by the light of the moon and
a few matches. He came back and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she is. Grinden Hall is what she says on that theah
sign-bode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise was in a flutter. &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Davidge held his watch up and lighted a match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little after one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully late,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The car was turning at right angles now, and following a
narrow track curling through a lawn studded with shrubbery.
There was a moment&rsquo;s view of all Washington beyond the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
valley of the moon-illumined river. Its lights gleamed in a
patient vigilance. It had the look of the holy city that it is.
The Capitol was like a mosque in Mecca, the Mecca of the
faithful who believe in freedom and equality. The Washington
Monument, picked out from the dark by a search-light,
was a lofty steeple in a dream-world.</p>
<p>Davidge caught a quick breath of piety and reverence.
Marie Louise was too frightened by her own destiny to think
of the world&rsquo;s anxieties.</p>
<p>The car raced round the circular road. Her eyes were
snatched from the drowsy town, small with distance, to the
imminent majesty of a great Colonial portico with columns
tall and stately and white, a temple of Parthenonian dignity
in the radiance of the priestly moon. There was not a light
in any window, no sign of life.</p>
<p>The car stopped. But&ndash;&ndash; Marie Louise simply dared not
face Polly and risk a scene in the presence of Davidge. She
tapped on the glass and motioned the driver to go on. He
could not believe her gestures. She leaned out and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on&ndash;&ndash;go on! I&rsquo;ll not stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge was puzzled, but he said nothing; and Marie
Louise made no explanation till they were outside again,
and then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m insane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not my party,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She tried to explain: &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a light to be seen.
They couldn&rsquo;t have got my telegram. They weren&rsquo;t expecting
me. They may not have been at home. I hadn&rsquo;t the courage
to stop and wake the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was not her real reason, but Davidge asked for no
other. If he noted that she was strangely excited over a
trifle like getting a few servants and a hostess out of bed, he
made no comment.</p>
<p>When she pleaded, &ldquo;Do you mind if I go back to Washington
with you?&rdquo; he chuckled: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly better than going
alone. But what will you do when you get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to the railroad station and sit up,&rdquo; Marie Louise
announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no end sorry to have been such a nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuisance!&rdquo; he protested, and left his intonation to convey
all the compliments he dared not utter.</p>
<p>The cab dived into another woods and ran clattering down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
a roving hill road. Up the opposite steep it went with a
weary gait. It crawled to the top with turtle-like labor.
Davidge knew the symptoms, and he frowned in the shadow,
yet smiled a little.</p>
<p>The car went banging down, held by a squealing brake.
The light grew faint, and in the glimmer there was a close
shave at the edge of a hazardous bridge over a deep, deep
ravine. The cab rolled forward on the rough planks under its
impetus, but it picked up no speed. Half-way across, it
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the matter?&rdquo; Marie Louise exclaimed.</p>
<p>Davidge leaned out and called to the driver, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter now?&rdquo; though he knew full well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas is gone, I reckon,&rdquo; the fellow snarled, as he got down.
After a moment&rsquo;s examination he confirmed his diagnosis.
&ldquo;Yep, gas is all gone. I been on the go too long on this one
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, where can you get some more gasolene?&rdquo;
said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearest garodge is at Rosslyn, I reckon, lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to say, lady. Three, fo&rsquo; mahls, most lahkly, and
prob&rsquo;ly closed naow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go wake it up at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanky, lady. I got mahty po&rsquo; feet for them hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; tew dew but wait fo&rsquo; somebody to come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along todes mawnin&rsquo; they ought to be somebody along,
milkman or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerful!&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Batt&rsquo;ries kind o&rsquo; sick, tew, looks lahk. I was engaged
by the houah, remember,&rdquo; the driver reminded them as he
clambered back to his place, put his feet up on the dashboard
and let his head roll into a position of ease.</p>
<p>The dimming lights waned and did not wax. By and by
they went where lights go when they go out. There was no
light now except the moonset, shimmering mistily across the
tree-tops of the rotunda of the forest, just enough to emphasize
the black of the well they were in.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>How would she take it?</p>
<p>That was what interested Davidge most. What
was she really like? And what would she do with this intractable
situation? What would the situation do with her?
For situations make people as well as people situations.</p>
<p>Now was the time for an acquaintance of souls. An
almost absolute dark erased them from each other&rsquo;s sight.
Their eyes were as useless as the useless eyes of fish in subterrene
caverns. Miss Webling could have told Davidge
the color of his eyes, of course, being a woman. But being a
man, he could not remember the color of hers, because he had
noted nothing about her eyes except that they were very
eye-ish.</p>
<p>He would have blundered ridiculously in describing her
appearance. His information of her character was all to gain.
He had seen her wandering about Washington homeless
among the crowds and turned from every door. She had
borne the ordeal as well as could be asked. She had accepted
his proffer of protection with neither terror nor assurance.</p>
<p>He supposed that in a similar plight the old-fashioned
woman&ndash;&ndash;or at least the ubiquitous woman of the special
eternal type that fictionists call &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;would have
been either a bleating, tremulous gazelle or a brazen siren.
But Miss Webling behaved like neither of these. She took
his gallantry with a matter-of-fact reasonableness, much as a
man would accept the offer of another man&rsquo;s companionship
on a tiresome journey. She gave none of those multitudinous
little signals by which a woman indicates that she is either
afraid that a man will try to hug her or afraid that he will
not. She was apparently planning neither to flirt nor to faint.</p>
<p>Davidge asked in a matter-of-fact tone: &ldquo;Do you think
you could walk to town? The driver says it&rsquo;s only three-fo&rsquo;
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>She sighed: &ldquo;My feet would never make it. And I have on
high-heeled boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His &ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; conveyed more sympathy than she expected.
He had another suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could probably get back to the home of Mrs. Widdicombe.
That isn&rsquo;t so far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered, bluntly, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made another proposal without much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d better walk in to Washington and get a cab
and come back for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was even blunter about this: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of
that. You&rsquo;re a wreck, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lied pluckily, &ldquo;Oh, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should! And I don&rsquo;t fancy the thought of staying
here alone with that driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled in the dark at the double-edged compliment of
implying that she was safer with him than with the driver.
But she did not hear his smile.</p>
<p>She apologized, meekly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you into an awful mess,
haven&rsquo;t I? I usually do make a mess of everything I undertake.
You&rsquo;d better beware of me after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it&rdquo; was a whole cyclopedia of condensed
gallantry.</p>
<p>They sat inept for a time, thinking aimlessly, seeing nothing,
hearing only the bated breath of the night wind groping
stealthily through the tree-tops, and from far beneath, the
still, small voice of a brook feeling its way down its unlighted
stairs.</p>
<p>At last her voice murmured, &ldquo;Are you quite too horribly
uncomfortable for words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was a deep-toned bell somehow articulate: &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t be more comfortable except for one thing. I&rsquo;m all
out of cigars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; He had a vague sense of her mental struggle before
she spoke again, timidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy you don&rsquo;t smoke cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I can&rsquo;t get cigars; any tobacco is better than none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another blank of troubled silence, then, &ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d
say that of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was both defiant and trepidate. He laughed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>A few years before he would have accepted a woman&rsquo;s
confession that she smoked cigarettes as a confession of
complete abandonment to all the other vices. A few years
farther back, indeed, and he would have said that any man
who smoked cigarettes was worthless. Since then he had seen
so many burly heroes and so many unimpeachable ladies
smoke them that he had almost forgotten his old prejudice.
In some of the United States it was then against the law for
men (not to say women and children) to sell or give away or
even to possess cigarettes. After the war crusades would
start against all forms of tobacco, and at least one clergyman
would call every man who smoked cigarettes a &ldquo;drug-addict.&rdquo;
It is impossible for anybody to be moral enough not to be
immoral to somebody.</p>
<p>But intolerances go out of style as suddenly as new creeds
come in. He knew soldiers who held a lighted stub in one
hand while they rolled a cigarette with the other. He knew
Red Cross saints who could puff a forbidden cigarette like
a prayer. He wondered how he or any one had ever made
such a fierce taboo of a wisp of aromatic leaves kindled in a
tiny parcel. Such strange things people choose for their tests
of virtue&ndash;&ndash;tests that have nothing whatever to do with the
case, whether savage or civilized folk invent them.</p>
<p>He heard Miss Webling fumbling in a hand-bag. He heard
the click of her rings against metal. He heard the little
noise of the portals of a cigarette-case opening. His hands
and hers stumbled together, and his fingers selected a little
cylinder from the row.</p>
<p>He produced a match and held the flame before her. He
filled his eyes with her vivid features as the glow detached
her from the dark. Of her eyes he saw only the big lids,
but he noted her lips, pursed a trifle with the kissing muscles,
and he sighed as she blew a smoke about her like a goddess
creating a cloud of vanishment. He lighted his own cigarette
and threw the match away. They returned to a perfect
gloom mitigated by the slight increase and decrease in the
vividness of their tobacco-tips as they puffed.</p>
<p>She was the first to speak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a whole box of fags in my hand-bag. I usually
have a good supply. When you want another&ndash;&ndash; Does it horrify
you to see a woman smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>He was very superior to his old bigotry. &ldquo;Quite the
contrary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was hardly honest enough, so he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did once, though. I remember how startled I was
years ago when I was in England and I saw ladies smoking
in hotel corridors; and on the steamer coming back, there
was a countess or something who sat in the balcony and
puffed away. Of course, at the big dinners in London they
smoked, too. They did at Sir Joseph&rsquo;s, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not see her wince at this name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were some odd fish surrounding old Sir Joseph.
Some of them I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out. He was just a
little hard to get at, himself. I got very huffy at the old
boy once or twice, I&rsquo;m sorry to say. It was about ships.
I&rsquo;m a crank on ships. Everybody has at least one mania.
That&rsquo;s mine&ndash;&ndash;ships. Sir Joseph and I quarreled about them.
He wanted to buy all I could make, but he was in no hurry
to have &rsquo;em finished. I told him he talked more like a
German trying to stop production than like a Britisher trying
to speed it up. That made him huffy. I&rsquo;m sorry I did him
such an injustice. When you insult a man, and he dies&ndash;&ndash;What
a terrible repartee dying is! He had offered me a big
price, too, but it&rsquo;s not money I want to make; it&rsquo;s ships.
And I want to see &rsquo;em at work. Did you ever see a ship
launched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing prettier. Come over to my shipyard and
I&rsquo;ll show you. We&rsquo;re going to put one over before long.
I&rsquo;ll let you christen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than that. The civilized world is starting out
on the most poetic job it ever undertook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. The German sharks are gradually dragging all our
shipping under water. The inventors don&rsquo;t seem able to
devise any cure for the submarines except to find &rsquo;em and
fight &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re hard to find, and they won&rsquo;t fight. But
they keep popping up and stabbing our pretty ships to death.
And now the great game is on, the greatest game that civilized
men ever fought with hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to try to build ships faster than the Hun
can sink &rsquo;em. Isn&rsquo;t that a glorious job for you? Was there
ever a&ndash;&ndash;well, a nobler idea? We can&rsquo;t kill the beast; so
we&rsquo;re going to choke him to death with food.&rdquo; He laughed
to hide his embarrassing exaltation.</p>
<p>She was not afraid of it: &ldquo;It is rather a stupendous inspiration,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it said he&rsquo;d rather have written Gray&rsquo;s &lsquo;Elegy&rsquo;
than taken Quebec? I&rsquo;d rather have thought up this thought
than written the Iliad. Nobody knows who invented the
idea. He&rsquo;s gone to oblivion already, but he has done more
for the salvation of freedom than all the poets of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This shocked her, yet thrilled her with its loftiness. She
thrilled to him suddenly, too. She saw that she was within
the aura of a fiery spirit&ndash;&ndash;a business man aflame. And
she saw in a white light that the builders of things, even
of perishable things, are as great as the weavers of immortal
words&ndash;&ndash;not so well remembered, of course, for posterity has
only the words. Poets and highbrows scorn them, but
living women who can see the living men are not so foolish.
They are apt to prefer the maker to the writer. They reward
the poet with a smile and a compliment, but give their
lives to the manufacturers, the machinists, the merchants.
Then the neglected poets and their toadies the critics grow
sarcastic about this and think that they have condemned
women for materialism when they are themselves blind to
its grandeur. They ignore the divinity that attends the
mining and smelting and welding and selling of iron things,
the hewing and sawing and planing of woods, the sowing
and reaping and distribution of foods. They make a priestcraft
and a ritual of artful language, and are ignorant of their
own heresy. But since they deal in words, they have a fearful
advantage and use it for their own glorification, as priests
are wont to do.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had a vague insight into the truth, but was
not aware of her own wisdom. She knew only that this
Davidge who had made himself her gallant, her messenger
and servant, was really a genius, a giant. She felt that the
r&ocirc;les should be reversed and she should be waiting upon
him.</p>
<p>In Sir Joseph&rsquo;s house there had been a bit of statuary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
representing Hercules and Omphale. The mighty one was
wearing the woman&rsquo;s kirtle and carrying her distaff, and
the girl was staggering under the lion-skin and leaning on
the bludgeon. Marie Louise always hated the group. It
seemed to her to represent just the way so many women
tried to master the men they infatuated. But Marie Louise
despised masterable men, and she had no wish to make a toy
of one. Yet she had wondered if a man and a woman could
not love each other more perfectly if neither were master or
mistress, but both on a parity&ndash;&ndash;a team, indeed.</p>
<p>Davidge enjoyed talking to her, at least. That comforted
her. When she came back from her meditations he was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My company is reaching out. We&rsquo;ve bought a big tract
of swamp, and we&rsquo;re filling it in and clearing it, and we&rsquo;re
going to lay out a shipyard there and turn out ships&ndash;&ndash;standardized
ships&ndash;&ndash;as fast as we can. We&rsquo;re steadying the
ground first, sinking concrete piles in steel casing&ndash;&ndash;if you put
&rsquo;em end to end, they&rsquo;d reach twenty-five miles. They&rsquo;re
just to hold the ground together. That&rsquo;s what the whole
country has got to do before it can really begin to begin&ndash;&ndash;put
some solid ground under its feet. When the ship is
launched she mustn&rsquo;t stick on the ways or in the mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;d rather go as a soldier, but I&rsquo;ve got no right
to. I can ride or walk all day, and shoot straight and stand
all kinds of weather, and killing Germans would just about
tickle me to death. But this is a time when every man
has got to do what he can do better than he can do anything
else. And I&rsquo;ve spent my life in shipyards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a common laborer first&ndash;&ndash;swinging a sledge; I had
an arm then! That was before we had compressed-air
riveters. I was a union man and went on strike and fought
scabs and made the bosses eat crow. Now I&rsquo;m one of the
bosses. I&rsquo;m what they call a capitalist and an oppressor
of labor. Now I put down strikes and fight the unions&ndash;&ndash;not
that I don&rsquo;t believe in &rsquo;em, not that I don&rsquo;t know where
labor was before they had unions and where it would be
without &rsquo;em to-day and to-morrow, but because all these
things have to be adjusted gradually, and because the main
thing, after all, is building ships&ndash;&ndash;just now, of course, especially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a workman I took pride in my job, and I
thought I was an artist at it. I wouldn&rsquo;t take anybody&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
lip. Now that I&rsquo;m a boss I have to take everybody&rsquo;s lip,
because I can&rsquo;t strike. I can&rsquo;t go to my boss and demand
higher wages and easier hours, because my boss is the market.
But I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s anything on earth that interests
you less than labor problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might if I knew the first thing about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the first thing is that they are the next war, the big
war after this one&rsquo;s over. The job is to keep it down till peace
comes. Then hell will pop&ndash;&ndash;if you&rsquo;ll pardon my French.
I&rsquo;m all for labor getting its rights, but some of the men
don&rsquo;t want the right to work&ndash;&ndash;they want the right to loaf.
I say let the sky be the limit of any man&rsquo;s opportunity&ndash;&ndash;the
sky and his own limitations and ambitions. But a lot of the
workmen don&rsquo;t want opportunity; they&rsquo;ve got no ambition;
they hate to build things. They talk about the terrible
conditions their families live in, and how gorgeously the
rich men live. But the rich men were poor once, and the
poor can be rich&ndash;&ndash;if they can and will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The war is going to be the fight between the makers and
the breakers, the uplifters and the down-draggers, you might
say. And it&rsquo;s going to be some war!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men on the wrong side&ndash;&ndash;what I call the wrong side,
at least&ndash;&ndash;are just as much our enemies as the Germans.
We&rsquo;ve got to watch &rsquo;em just as close. They&rsquo;d just as soon
burn an unfinished ship as the Germans would sink her when
she&rsquo;s on her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little ship I&rsquo;m building now! Would you believe it?
It has to be guarded every minute. Most of our men are all
right. They&rsquo;d work themselves to death for the ship, and
they pour out their sweat like prayers. But sneaks get in
among &rsquo;em, and it only takes a fellow with a bomb one minute
to undo the six months&rsquo; work of a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about your ship,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>A ship she could understand. It was personal and real;
labor theories were as foreign to her as problems in metaphysics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s my first-born, this ship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course
I&rsquo;ve built a lot of other ships, but they were for other people&ndash;&ndash;just
jobs, for wages or commissions. This one is all my
own&ndash;&ndash;a freighter, ugly as sin and commodious as hell&ndash;&ndash;I
beg your pardon! But the world needs freighters&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
hungry mobs of Europe, they&rsquo;ll be glad to see my little ship
come in, if ever she does. If she doesn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash; But she&rsquo;ll
last a few trips before they submarine her&ndash;&ndash;I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell silent among his visions and left her to her own.</p>
<p>He saw himself wandering about a shipyard, a poor thing,
but his own. His mind was like a mold-loft full of designs
and detail-drawings to scale, blue-prints and models. On the
way a ship was growing for him. As yet she was a ghastly
thing all ribs, like the skeleton of some ancient sea-monster
left ashore at high tide and perished eons back, leaving only
the bones.</p>
<p>His fancy saw her transverses taking on their iron flesh.
He saw the day of her nativity. He heard them knock out
the blocks that lowered the sliding-ways to the groundways
and sent her swirling into the sea.</p>
<p>He saw her ready for her cargo, saw a Niagara of wheat
cascading into her hold. He saw her go forth into the sea.</p>
<p>Then he saw the ship stagger, a wound opened in her side,
from the bullet of a submarine.</p>
<p>It was all so vivid that he spoke aloud in a frenzy of ire:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Germans kill my ship I&rsquo;ll kill a German! By
God, I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was startled by the sound of his own voice, and he
begged her pardon humbly.</p>
<p>She had been away in reverie, too. The word &ldquo;submarine&rdquo;
had sent her back into her haunting remembrances of the
<i>Lusitania</i> and of her own helpless entanglement in the fate
of other ships&ndash;&ndash;their names as unknown to her as the names
and faces of the men that died with them, or perished of
starvation and thirst in the lifeboats sent adrift. The thought
of these poor anonymities frightened her. She shuddered
with such violence that Davidge was startled from his own
wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having a chill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish you would take
my coat. You don&rsquo;t want to get sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head and chattered, &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better get out and walk up and down this
bridge awhile. There&rsquo;s not even a lap-robe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to walk, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped out, aided by his hand, a strong hand, and
warm about her icy fingers. Her knees were weak, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
set her elbow in the hollow of his arm and guided her. They
walked like the blind leading the blind through a sea of
pitch. The only glimmer was the little scratches of light
pinked in the dead sky by a few stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful overhead, if you&rsquo;re going that way,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Davidge quoted.</p>
<p>He set out briskly, but Marie Louise hung back timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast! I can&rsquo;t see a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best time to keep moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you afraid to push on when you can&rsquo;t see
where you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can ever tell where he&rsquo;s going? The sunlight is no
guaranty. We&rsquo;re all bats in the daytime and not cats at
night. The main thing is to sail on and on and on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught a little of his recklessness&ndash;&ndash;suffered him to
hurry her to and fro through the inky air till she was panting
for breath and tired. Then they groped to the rail and peered
vainly down at the brook, which, like an unbroken child,
was heard and not seen. They leaned their elbows on the rail
and stared into the muffling gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have another of your cigarettes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>There was a cozy fireside moment as they took their lights
from the same match. When he threw the match overboard
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a human life, eh? A little spark between dark and
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was surprised at stumbling into rhyme, and apologized.
But she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I rather like that. It reminds me of a
poem about a rain-storm&ndash;&ndash;Russell Lowell&rsquo;s, I fancy; it told
of a flock of sheep scampering down a dusty road and clattering
across a bridge and back to the dust again. He said it
was like human life, &lsquo;a little noise between two silences.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; was the best Davidge could do. But the agony
of the brevity of existence seized them both by the hearts,
and their hearts throbbed and bled like birds crushed in the
claws of hawks. Their hearts had such capabilities of joy,
such songs in them, such love and longing, such delight in
beauty&ndash;&ndash;and beauty was so beautiful, so frequent, so thrilling!
Yet they could spend but a glance, a sigh, a regret, a gratitude,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
and then their eyes were out, their ears still, their lips cold,
their hearts dust. The ache of it was beyond bearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk. I&rsquo;m cold again,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>He felt that she needed the sense of hurry, and he went so
fast that she had to run to keep up with him. There seemed
to be some comfort in the privilege of motion for its own sake;
motion was life; motion was godhood; motion was escape
from the run-down clock of death.</p>
<p>Back and forth they kept their promenade, till her body
refused to answer the whips of restlessness. Her brain began
to shut up shop. It would do no more thinking this night.</p>
<p>She stumbled toward the taxicab. Davidge lifted her in,
and she sank down, completely done. She fell asleep.</p>
<p>Davidge took his place in the cab and wondered lazily
at the quaint adventure. He was only slightly concerned
with wondering at the cause of her uneasiness. He was
used to minding his own business.</p>
<p>She slept so well that when the groping search-light of a
coming automobile began to slash the night and the rubber
wheels boomed across the bridge she did not waken. If the
taxi-driver heard its sound, he preferred to pretend not to.
The passengers in the passing car must have been surprised,
but they took their wonderment with them. We so often
imagine mischief when there is innocence and <i>vice versa</i>;
for opportunity is just as likely to create distaste as interest
and the lack of it to instigate enterprise.</p>
<p>Davidge drowsed and smiled contentedly in the dark and
did not know that he was not awake until at some later time
he was half aroused by the meteoric glow and whiz of another
automobile. It had gone before he was quite awake, and he
sank back into sleep.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, many black hours had slid by and daylight
was come; the rosy fingers of light were moving about,
recreating the world to vision, sketching a landscape hazily
on a black canvas, then stippling in the colors, and finishing,
swiftly but gradually, the details to an inconceivable minuteness
of definition, giving each leaf its own sharp contour and
every rock its every facet. From the brook below a mistlike
cigarette smoke exhaled. The sky was crimson, then pink,
then amber, then blue.</p>
<p>Birds began to twitter, to fashion little crystal stanzas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
and to hurl themselves about the valley as if catapults propelled
them. One songster perched on the iron rail of the
bridge and practised a vocal lesson, cocking his head from
side to side and seeming to approve his own skill.</p>
<p>A furred caterpillar resumed his march across the Appian
Way, making of each crack between boards a great abyss to
be bridged cautiously with his own body. The day&rsquo;s work
was begun, while Davidge drowsed and smiled contentedly
at the side of the strange, sleeping woman as if they had been
married for years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>The sky was filled with morning when a noise startled
Davidge out of nullity. He was amazed to find a
strange woman asleep at his elbow. He remembered her
suddenly.</p>
<p>With a clatter of wheels and cans and hoofs a milkman&rsquo;s
wagon and team came out of the hills. Davidge stepped down
from the car and stopped the loud-voiced, wide-mouthed
driver with a gesture. He spoke in a low voice which the
milkman did not copy. The taxi-driver woke to the extent
of one eye and a horrible yawn, while Davidge explained his
plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gasolene gave out, hey?&rdquo; said the milkman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly did,&rdquo; said Davidge, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d be very much
obliged if you&rsquo;d get me some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-all, I&rsquo;m purty busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you anything you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The milkman was modest in his ambitions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d two dollars strike ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five would be better if you hurried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This looked suspicious, but the milkman consented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-all, all right, but what would I fetch the gasolene in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of your milk-cans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all fuller melk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy one, milk and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-all, I reckon I&rsquo;ll hev to oblige you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s five dollars on account. There&rsquo;ll be five more when
you get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa-all, all ri-ight. Get along there, Jawn Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Henry got along. Even his <i>cloppety-clop</i> did not
waken Miss Webling.</p>
<p>The return of the rattletrap and the racket of filling the
tank with the elixir finished her sleep, however. She woke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
in confusion, finding herself sitting up, dressed, in her little
room, with three strange men at work outside.</p>
<p>When the tank was filled, Davidge entered her compartment
with a cheery &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; and slammed the door after
him. The gasolene, like the breath of a god, gave life to the
dead. The car snarled and jumped, and went roaring across
the bridge, up the hill and down another, and down that
and up another.</p>
<p>Here they caught, through a frame of leaves, a glimpse of
Washington in the sunrise, a great congregation of marble
temples and trees and sky-colored waters, the shaft of the
Monument lighted with the milky radiance of a mountain
peak on its upper half, the lower part still dusk with valley
shadow, and across the plateau of roofs the solemn Capitol
in as mythical a splendor as the stately dome that Kubla
Khan decreed in Xanadu.</p>
<p>This sight of Canaan from Pisgah-height was no luxury
to the taxi-driver, and he hustled his coffee-grinder till he
reached Rosslyn once more, crossed the Potomac&rsquo;s many-tinted
stream, and rattled through Georgetown and the shabby,
sleeping little shops of M Street into the tree-tunnels of
Washington.</p>
<p>He paused to say, &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge and Marie Louise looked their chagrin. They still
had no place to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Pennsylvania Station,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;We can
at least get breakfast there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The streets of Washington are never so beautiful as at this
still hour when nothing stirs but the wind in the trees and the
grass on the lawns, and hardly anybody is abroad except the
generals on their bronze horses fronting their old battles
with heroic eyes. The station outside was something Olympic
but unfrequented. Inside, it was a vast cathedral of untenanted
pews.</p>
<p>Davidge paid the driver a duke&rsquo;s ransom. There was no
porter about, and he carried Marie Louise&rsquo;s suit-cases to the
parcel-room. Her baggage had had a long journey. She
retreated to the women&rsquo;s room for what toilet she could
make, and came forth with a very much washed face. Somnambulistic
negroes took their orders at the lunch-counter.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had weakly decided to return to New York
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
again, but the hot coffee was full of defiance, and she said that
she would make another try at Mrs. Widdicombe as soon as a
human hour arrived.</p>
<p>And she showed a tactfulness that won much respect from
Davidge when she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do get your morning paper and read it. I&rsquo;m sure I have
nothing to say that I haven&rsquo;t said, and if I had, it could
wait till you find out how the battle goes in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bought her a paper, too, and they sat on a long bench,
exchanging comments on the news that made almost every
front page a chapter in world history.</p>
<p>She heard him groan with rage. When she looked up he
pointed to the submarine record of that week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last week the losses took a horrible jump&ndash;&ndash;forty ships
of over sixteen hundred tons. This week it&rsquo;s almost as bad&ndash;&ndash;thirty-eight
ships of over sixteen hundred, thirteen ships
under, and eight fishing-vessels. Think of it&ndash;&ndash;all of &rsquo;em
merchant-ships!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon I&rsquo;ve got to send my ship out to run the
gantlet. She&rsquo;s like Little Red Riding Hood going through the
forest to take old Granny Britain some food. And the wolves
are waiting for her. What a race of people, what a pack of
beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise had an idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a pretty name for
your ship&ndash;&ndash;<i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>. Why don&rsquo;t you give her
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. &ldquo;The name would be heavier than the
cargo. I wonder what the crew would make of it. No,
this ship, my first one, is to be named after&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he lowered
his voice as one does on entering a church&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;after my
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s beautiful!&rdquo; Marie Louise said. &ldquo;And will she
be there to christen&ndash;&ndash; Oh, I remember, you said&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded three or four times in wretchedness. But the
grief was his own, and he must not exploit it. He assumed
an abrupt cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll name the next ship after you, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too glorious to be believed. What bouquet or
jewel could equal it? She clapped her hands like a child
hearing a Christmas promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your first name, Miss Webling?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>She suddenly realized that they were not, after all, such
old friends as the night had seemed to make them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first two names,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are Marie Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Well, then we&rsquo;ll call the ship <i>Marie Louise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw that he was a little disappointed in the name, so
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a girl they called me Mamise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was puzzled to see how this startled him.</p>
<p>He jumped audibly and fastened a searching gaze on her.
Mamise! He had thought of Mamise when he saw her, and
now she gave the name. Could she possibly be the Mamise he
remembered? He started to ask her, but checked himself and
blushed. A fine thing it would be to ask this splendid young
princess, &ldquo;Pardon me, Princess, but were you playing in
cheap vaudeville a few years ago?&rdquo; It was an improbable
coincidence that he should meet her thus, but an almost
impossible coincidence that she should wear both the name
and the mien of Mamise and not be Mamise. But he dared
not ask her.</p>
<p>She noted his blush and stammer, but she was afraid to
ask their cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mamise</i> it shall be,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And she answered, &ldquo;I was never so honored in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he warned her, &ldquo;the boat isn&rsquo;t built yet.
In fact, the new yard isn&rsquo;t built yet. There&rsquo;s many a slip
&rsquo;twixt the keel and the ship. She might never live to
be launched. Some of these sneaking loafers on our side
may blow her up before the submarines get a chance at
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There he was, speaking of submarines once more! She
shivered, and she looked at the clock and got up and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try Mrs. Widdicombe now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go along,&rdquo; said Davidge.</p>
<p>But she shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken enough of your life&ndash;&ndash;for
the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trying to concoct a felicitous reply, he achieved only an
eloquent silence. He put her and her luggage aboard a taxicab,
and then she gave him her most cordial hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could never hope to thank you enough,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I won&rsquo;t begin to try. Send me your address when you have
one, and I&rsquo;ll mail you Mrs. Widdicombe&rsquo;s confidential
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
telephone number. I do want to see you soon again, unless
you&rsquo;ve had enough of me for a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did very handsomely by the lead she gave him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have enough&ndash;&ndash;not in a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxi-driver snipped the strands of their gaze as he
whisked her away.</p>
<p>Marie Louise felt a forenoon elation in the cool air and the
bright streets, thick with men and women in herds hurrying
to their patriotic tasks, and a multitude of officers and enlisted
men seeking their desks. She was here to join them, and she
hoped that it would not be too hard to find some job with a
little thrill of service in it.</p>
<p>As she went through Georgetown now M Street was different&ndash;&ndash;full
of marketers and of briskness. The old bridge
was crowded. As her car swooped up the hills and skirted the
curves to Polly Widdicombe&rsquo;s she began to be afraid again.
But she was committed to the adventure and she was eager
for the worst of it. She found the house without trouble
and saw in the white grove of columns Polly herself, bidding
good-by to her husband, whose car was waiting at the foot
of the steps.</p>
<p>Polly hailed Marie Louise with cries of such delight that
before the cab had made the circle and drawn up at the steps
the hunted look was gone and youth come back to Marie
Louise&rsquo;s anxious smile. Polly kissed her and presented her
husband, pointing to the gold leaves on his shoulders with
militaristic pride.</p>
<p>Widdicombe blushed and said: &ldquo;Fearless desk-fighter has
to hurry off to battle with ruthless stenographers. Such are
the horrors of war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He insisted on paying Marie Louise&rsquo;s driver, though she
said, &ldquo;Women will never be free so long as men insist on
paying all their bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly said: &ldquo;Hush, or the brute will set me free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed Polly, waved to Marie Louise, stepped into his
car, and shot away.</p>
<p>Polly watched him with devout eyes and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor boy! he&rsquo;s dying to get across into the trenches, but
they won&rsquo;t take him because he&rsquo;s a little near-sighted, thank
God! And he works like a dog, day and night.&rdquo; Then she
returned to the rites of hospitality. &ldquo;Had your breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;At the station.&rdquo; The truth for once coincided very
pleasantly with convenience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I know what you want,&rdquo; said Polly, &ldquo;a bath and
a nap. After that all-night train-trip you ought to be a
wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly led her to a welcoming room that would have been
quite pretty enough if it had had only a bed and a chair.
Marie Louise felt as if she had come out of the wilderness into
a city of refuge. Polly had an engagement, a committee
meeting of women war-workers, and would not be back until
luncheon-time. Marie Louise steeped herself in a hot tub,
then in a long sweet sleep in a real bed. She was wakened
by the voices of children, and looked out from her window to
see the Widdicombe tots drilling in a company of three
with a drum, a flag, and a wooden gun. The American army
was not much bigger compared with the European nations in
arms, but it would grow.</p>
<p>Polly came home well charged with electricity, the new-woman
idea that was claiming half of the war, the true
squaw-spirit that takes up the drudgery at home while the
braves go out to swap missiles with the enemy. When Marie
Louise said that she, too, had come to Washington to get
into harness somewhere, Polly promised her a plethora of
opportunities.</p>
<p>At luncheon Polly was reminded of the fact that a photographer
was coming over from Washington. He had asked
for sittings, and she had acceded to his request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never can get photographs enough of my homely self,&rdquo;
said Polly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always hoping that by some accident the
next one will make me look as I want to look&ndash;&ndash;make ithers
see me as I see mysel&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the camera-man arrived Polly insisted that Marie
Louise must pose, too, and grew so urgent that she consented
at last, to quiet her. They spent a harrowing afternoon
striking attitudes all over the place, indoors and out, standing,
sitting, heads and half-lengths, profile and three-quarters
and full face. Their muscles ached with the struggle to
assume and retain beatific expressions on an empty soul.</p>
<p>The consequences of that afternoon of self-impersonation
were far-reaching for Marie Louise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>According to the Washingtonian custom, one of the new
photographs appeared the following Sunday in each of the four
newspapers. The Sunday after that Marie Louise&rsquo;s likeness
appeared with &ldquo;Dolly Madison&rsquo;s&rdquo; and Jean Elliott&rsquo;s syndicated
letters on &ldquo;The Week in Washington&rdquo; in Sunday
supplements throughout the country. Every now and then
her likeness popped out at her from <i>Town and Country</i>, <i>Vogue</i>,
<i>Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar</i>, <i>The Spur</i>, what not?</p>
<p>One of those countless images fell into the hands of Jake
Nuddle, who had been keeping an incongruous eye on the
Sunday supplements for some time. This time the double of
Mamise was not posed as a farmerette in an English landscape,
but as a woman of fashion in a Colonial drawing-room.</p>
<p>He hurried to his wife with the picture, and she called it
&ldquo;Mamise&rdquo; with a recrudescent anguish of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in this country now, the paper says,&rdquo; said Jake.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in Washington, and if I was you I&rsquo;d write her a little
letter astin&rsquo; her is she our sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle was crying too loosely to note that &ldquo;our.&rdquo;
The more Jake considered the matter the less he liked the
thought of waiting for a letter to go and an answer to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet &rsquo;em face to face; that&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; he declared at last.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll just take a trip to the little old capital m&rsquo;self.
I can tell the rest the c&rsquo;mittee I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to put a few things up
to some them Senators and Congersmen. That&rsquo;ll get my
expenses paid for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There simply was nobody that Jake Nuddle would not
cheat, if he could.</p>
<p>His always depressing wife suggested: &ldquo;Supposin&rsquo; the lady
says she ain&rsquo;t Mamise, how you goin&rsquo; to prove she is? You
never seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake snarled at her for a fool, but he knew that she was right.
He resisted the dismal necessity as long as he could, and then
extended one of his most cordial invitations:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, hell! I reckon I&rsquo;ll have to drag you along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grumbled and cursed his fate and resolved to make
Mamise pay double for ruining his excursion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>For a time Marie Louise had the solace of being busy
and of nibbling at the edge of great occasions. The
nation was reconstituting its whole life, and Washington was
the capital of all the Allied peoples, their brazen serpent and
their promise of salvation. Almost everybody was doing
with his or her might what his or her hand found to do.
Repetition and contradiction of effort abounded; there was
every confusion of counsel and of action. But the Republic
was gathering itself for a mighty leap into the arena. For
the first time women were being not merely permitted, but
pleaded with, to lend their aid.</p>
<p>Marie Louise rolled bandages at a Red Cross room presided
over by a pleasant widow, Mrs. Perry Merithew, with a son
in the aviation, who was forever needing bandages. Mamise
tired of these, bought a car and joined the Women&rsquo;s Motor
Corps. She had a collision with a reckless wretch named
&ldquo;Pet&rdquo; Bettany, and resigned. She helped with big festivals,
toiled day and night at sweaters, and finally bought herself
a knitting-machine and spun out half a dozen pairs of socks
a day, by keeping a sweatshop pace for sweatshop hours.
She was trying to find a more useful job. The trouble was
that everybody wanted to be at something, to get into a
uniform of some sort, to join the universal mobilization.</p>
<p>She went out little of evenings, preferring to keep herself
in the seclusion of the Rosslyn home. Gradually her fears
subsided and she felt that her welcome was wearing through.
She began to look for a place to live. Washington was in a
panic of rentals. Apartments cost more than houses. A
modest creature who had paid seventy-five dollars a month
for a little flat let it for five hundred a month for the duration
of the war. A gorgeous Sultana who had a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar-a-month
apartment rented it for a thousand
dollars a month &ldquo;for the duration.&rdquo; Marie Louise had money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
enough, but she could hardly find anything that it would
buy.</p>
<p>She planned to secure a clerical post in some of the offices.
She took up shorthand and poked a typewriter and read books
on system and efficiency, then gave them up as Greek.</p>
<p>Once in a while she saw Ross Davidge. He suffered an
intermittent fever of hope and despondency. He, too, was
trying to do his bit, but he was lost in the maelstrom swirling
through the channels of official life. He would come to town
for a few days, wait about, fuming, and return in disgust to
his shipyard. It was not altogether patriotism that pulled him
back to Washington. Marie Louise was there, and he lost
several appointments with the great folk he came to see, because
their hours clashed with Marie Louise&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On one of his voyages he was surprised to find at his hotel
an invitation to dine at Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s. Little as he knew
of the eminent ones of the fashionable world, he knew the
famous name of Prothero. He had spoken with reverence
always of her late husband, one of the rebuilders of the
American navy, a voice crying in the wilderness for a revival
of the ancient glories of the merchant marine. Davidge had
never met him or his widow. He felt that he could not
refuse the unexplained opportunity to pay at least his respects
to the relict of his idol.</p>
<p>But he wondered by what means Mrs. Prothero, whom
everybody had heard of, had heard of him. When he entered
her door on the designated evening his riddle was answered.</p>
<p>The butler glanced at his card, then picked from a heap on
the console a little envelope which he proffered on his tray.
The envelope was about the size of those that new-born
parents use to inclose the proclamation of the advent of a new-born
infant. The card inside Davidge&rsquo;s envelope carried the
legend, &ldquo;Miss Webling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler led him to the drawing-room door and announced
him. There indeed was Marie Louise, arm in arm with a
majestic granddam in a coronet of white hair.</p>
<p>Marie Louise put out her hand, and Davidge went to it.
She clasped his and passed it on to Mrs. Prothero with a
character:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the great Mr. Davidge, the shipwright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero pressed his hand and kept it while she said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&ldquo;It is like Marie Louise to bring youth to cheer up an old
crone like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge muffed the opening horribly. Instead of saying
something brilliant about how young Mrs. Prothero looked,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth? I&rsquo;m a hundred years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; Mrs. Prothero cried. &ldquo;Then how old does
that make me, in the Lord&rsquo;s name&ndash;&ndash;a million?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge could not even recover the foot he had put in it.
By looking foolish and keeping silent he barely saved himself
from adding the other foot. Mrs. Prothero smiled at his
discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m too ancient to be caught by pretty
speeches&ndash;&ndash;or to like the men who have &rsquo;em always ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed his hand again and turned to welcome the
financial Cyclops, James Dyckman, and his huge wife, and
Captain Fargeton, a foreign military attach&eacute; with service
chevrons and wound-chevrons and a <i>croix de guerre</i>, and a wife,
who had been Mildred Tait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that and an American spouse!&rdquo; said Davidge to
Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you never had an American spouse?&rdquo; she asked,
brazenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one!&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
<p>Major and Polly Widdicombe had come in with Marie
Louise, and Davidge drifted into their circle. The great room
filled gradually with men of past or future fame, and the poor
women who were concerned in enduring its acquisition.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was radiant in mood and queenly in attire.
Davidge was startled by the magnificence of her jewelry.
Some of it was of old workmanship, royal heirloomry. Her
accent was decidedly English, yet her race was undoubtedly
American. The many things about her that had puzzled him
subconsciously began to clamor at least for the attention of
curiosity. He watched her making the best of herself, as a
skilful woman does when she is all dressed up in handsome
scenery among toplofty people.</p>
<p>Polly was describing the guests as they came in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Colonel Harvey Forbes. His name has been sent
to Congress for approval as a brigadier-general. I knew him
in the midst of the wildest scandal&ndash;&ndash;remind me to tell you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
He was only a captain then. He&rsquo;ll probably end as a king
or something. This war is certainly good to some people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge watched Marie Louise studying the somber officer.
He was a bit jealous, shamed by his own civilian clothes.
Suddenly Marie Louise&rsquo;s smile at Polly&rsquo;s chatter stopped short,
shriveled, then returned to her face with a look of effort.
Her muscles seemed to be determined that her lips should
not droop.</p>
<p>Davidge heard the butler announce:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clifton-Wyatt and General Sir Hector Havendish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge wondered which of the two names could have so
terrified Marie Louise. Naturally he supposed that it was the
man&rsquo;s. He turned to study the officer in his British uniform.
He saw a tall, loose-jointed, jovial man of horsy look and
carriage, and no hint of mystery&ndash;&ndash;one would say an intolerance
of mystery.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt was equally amiable. She laughed and
wrung the hands of Mrs. Prothero. They were like two school-girls
met in another century.</p>
<p>Davidge noted that Marie Louise turned her back and
listened with extraordinary interest to Major Widdicombe&rsquo;s
old story about an Irishman who did or said something or
other. Davidge heard Mrs. Prothero say to Lady Clifton-Wyatt,
with all the joy in the world:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose is here but our Marie Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Marie Louise?&rdquo; Lady Clifton-Wyatt echoed, with a
slight chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Marie Louise Webling. It was at her house that I
met you. Where has the child got to? There she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without raising her voice she focused it between Marie
Louise&rsquo;s shoulder-blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie Louise, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise turned and came up like a wax image on
casters pulled forward by an invisible window-dresser. Lady
Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s limber attitude grew erect, deadly, ominously
hostile. She looked as if she would turn Marie Louise to
stone with a Medusa glare, but she evidently felt that she had
no right to commit petrifaction in Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s home;
so she bowed and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yis! How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Davidge&rsquo;s amazement, Miss Webling, instead of meeting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
the rebuff in kind, wavered before it and bowed almost gratefully.
Then, to Davidge&rsquo;s confusion, Lady Clifton-Wyatt
marched on him with a gush of cordiality as if she had been
looking for him around the Seven Seas. She remembered him,
called him by name and told him that she had seen his pickchah
in one of the papahs, as one of the creatahs of the new fleet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero was stunned for a moment by the scene, but
she had passed through so many women&rsquo;s wars that she had
learned to ignore them even when&ndash;&ndash;especially when&ndash;&ndash;her
drawing-room was the battleground.</p>
<p>Her mind was drawn from the incident by the materialization
of the butler.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt, noting that the tide was setting toward
the dining-room and that absent-minded Sir Hector was
floating along the current at the elbow of the pretty young
girl, said to Davidge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you taking me out or&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a horrible moment, for all its unimportance, but he
mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I am sorry, but&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Miss Webling&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; said Lady Clifton-Wyatt. It was a very
short &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and a very long &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; a sort of gliding, crushing
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; It went over him like a tank, leaving him flat.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt reached Sir Hector&rsquo;s arm in a few strides
and unhooked him from the girl&ndash;&ndash;also the girl from him. The
girl was grateful. Sir Hector was used to disappointments.</p>
<p>Davidge went to Marie Louise, who stood lonely and distraught.
He felt ashamed of his word &ldquo;sorry&rdquo; and hoped
she hadn&rsquo;t heard it. Silently and crudely he angled his
arm, and she took it and went along with him in a somnambulism.</p>
<p>Davidge, manlike, tried to cheer up his elbow-mate by a
compliment. A man&rsquo;s first aid to a woman in distress is a
compliment or a few pats of the hand. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the second big dinner you and I have attended.
There were bushels of flowers between us before, but I&rsquo;d
rather see your face than a ton of roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compliment fell out like a ton of coal. He did not like
it at all. She seemed not to have heard him, for she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>Then, as the occultists say, he went into the silence. There
is nothing busier than a silence at a dinner. The effort
to think with no outlet in speech kept up such a roaring in
his head that he could hardly grasp what the rest were saying.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt sat at Davidge&rsquo;s right and kept invading
his quiet communion with Marie Louise by making
remarks of the utmost graciousness somehow fermented&ndash;&ndash;like
wine turned vinegar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you remember when we met in London,
Mr. Davidge? It was just after the poor <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was,&rdquo; said Davidge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at Sir Joseph Webling&rsquo;s. You knew he was dead,
didn&rsquo;t you? Or did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Webling told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did she! I was curious to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cast a look past him at Marie Louise and saw that the
girl was about ready to make a scene. She smiled and
deferred further torture.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero supervened. She had the beautiful theory
that the way to make her guests happy was to get them to
talking about themselves. She tried to draw Davidge out
of his shell. But he talked about her husband instead, and of
the great work he had done for the navy. He turned the
tables of graciousness on her. Her nod recognized the
chivalry; her lips smiled with pride in her husband&rsquo;s praise;
her eyes glistened with an old regret made new. &ldquo;He would
have been useful now,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the man who laid the keel-blocks of our new
navy,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;The thing we haven&rsquo;t got and have
got to get is a merchant marine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could talk of that, though he could not celebrate himself.
He was still going strong when the dinner was finished.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero clung to the old custom. She took the women
away with her to the drawing-room, leaving the men alone.</p>
<p>Davidge noted that Lady Clifton-Wyatt left the dining-room
with a kind of eagerness, Marie Louise reluctantly.
She cast him a look that seemed to cry &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; He wondered
what the feud could be that threw Miss Webling into
such apparent panic. He could not tolerate the thought that
she had a yellow streak in her.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VI_1' id='CHAPTER_VI_1'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt, like many another woman, was
kept in order by the presence of men. She knew that the
least charming of attributes in masculine eyes are the female
feline, the gift and art of claws.</p>
<p>Men can be catty, too&ndash;&ndash;tom-catty, yet contemptibly feline
when they are not on their good behavior. There are times
when the warning, &ldquo;Gentlemen, there are ladies present,&rdquo;
restores them to order as quickly as the entrance of a
teacher turns a school-room of young savages into an assembly
of young saints.</p>
<p>The women in Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s drawing-room could not
hear any of the words the men mixed with their smoke, but
they could hear now and then a muffled explosion of laughter
of a quality that indicated what had provoked it.</p>
<p>The women, too, were relieved of a certain constraint by
their isolation. They seemed to enjoy the release. It was
like getting their minds out of tight corsets. They were not
impatient for the men&ndash;&ndash;as some of the men may have imagined.
These women were of an age where they had something else
to think of besides men. They had careers to make or keep
among women as well as the men among men.</p>
<p>The servants kept them on guard till the coffee, tobacco,
and liqueurs were distributed. Then recess was declared.
Marie Louise found herself on a huge tapestried divan provided
with deep, soft cushions that held her like a quicksands.
On one side of her was the mountainous Mrs. Dyckman
resembling a stack of cushions cased in silk; on the other was
Mildred Tait Fargeton, whose father had been ambassador
to France.</p>
<p>Marie Louise listened to their chatter with a frantic impatience.
Polly was heliographing ironic messages with her
eyes. Polly was hemmed in by the wife of a railroad juggler,
who was furious at the Administration because it did not put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
all its transportation problems in her husband&rsquo;s hands. She
would not have intrusted him with the buying of a spool of
thread; but that was different.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero was monopolized by Lady Clifton-Wyatt.
Marie Louise could see that she herself was the theme of the
talk, for Mrs. Prothero kept casting startled glances Marie-Louise-ward,
and Lady Clifton-Wyatt glances of baleful
stealth.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had proved often enough that she was no
coward, but even the brave turn poltroon when they fight
without a sense of justification. Her pride told her that she
ought to cross over to Lady Clifton-Wyatt and demand that
she speak up. But her sense of guilt robbed her of her courage.
And that oath she had given to Mr. Verrinder without the
least reluctance now loomed before her as the greatest mistake
of her life. Her sword and shield were both in pawn.</p>
<p>She gave herself up for lost and had only one hope, that
the men would not come in&ndash;&ndash;especially that Ross Davidge
would not come in in time to learn what Lady Clifton-Wyatt
was so eager to publish. She gave Mrs. Prothero up for lost,
too, and Polly. But she wanted to keep Ross Davidge fond
of her.</p>
<p>Then in a lull Mrs. Prothero spoke up sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t believe it, my dear. I don&rsquo;t know that
I ever saw a German spy, but that child is not one. I&rsquo;d stake
my life on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the avalanche!&rdquo; thought Marie Louise.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;spy&rdquo; was beginning to have more than an
academic or fictional interest to Americans, and it caught
the ear of every person present.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dyckman and Mme. Fargeton sat up as straight as
their curves permitted and gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A German spy! Who? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly Widdicombe sprang to her feet and darted to Mrs.
Prothero&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely! Tell me who she is! I&rsquo;m dying to shoot
a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise sickened at the bloodthirstiness of Polly the
insouciante.</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero tried to put down the riot of interest by
saying:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing. Lady Clifton-Wyatt is just joking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt was at bay. She shot a glance at
Marie Louise and insisted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not! I tell you she is a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a spy?&rdquo; Polly demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Webling,&rdquo; said Lady Clifton-Wyatt.</p>
<p>Polly began to giggle; then she frowned with disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought you meant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean it, and if you&rsquo;ll take my advice you&rsquo;ll be
warned in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly turned, expecting to find Marie Louise showing her
contemptuous amusement, but the look she saw on Marie
Louise&rsquo;s face was disconcerting. Polly&rsquo;s loyalty remained
staunch. She hated Lady Clifton-Wyatt anyway, and the
thought that she might be telling the truth made her a little
more hatable. Polly stormed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t permit you to slander my best friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t slahnda hah, and
if she is yaw best friend&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt hated Polly and was glad of the weapon
against her. Polly felt a sudden terrific need of retorting
with a blow. Men had never given up the fist on the mouth
as the simple, direct answer to an insult too complicated for
any other retort. She wanted to slap Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s
face. But she did not know how to fight. Perhaps women
will acquire the male prerogative of the smash in the jaw
along with the other once exclusive masculine privileges. It
will do them no end of good and help to clarify all life for them.
But for the present Polly could only groan, &ldquo;Agh!&rdquo; and turn
to throw an arm about Marie Louise and drag her forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d believe one word of Marie Louise against a thousand
of yours,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&ndash;&ndash;ahsk hah, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly was crying mad, and madder than ever because she
hated herself for crying when she got mad. She almost
sobbed now to Marie Louise, &ldquo;Tell her it&rsquo;s a dirty, rotten lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise had been dragged to her feet. She temporized,
&ldquo;What has she sai-said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly snickered nervously, &ldquo;Oh, nothing&ndash;&ndash;except that you
were a German spy.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>And now somewhere, somehow, Marie Louise found the
courage of desperation. She laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Clifton-Wyatt is notori&ndash;&ndash;famous for her quaint
sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt sneered, &ldquo;Could one expect a spy to
admit it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise smiled patiently. &ldquo;Probably not. But
surely even you would hardly insist that denying it proves it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sophistry was too tangled for Polly. She spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the details, Lady Clifton-Wyatt&ndash;&ndash;if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the chorus murmured.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt braced herself. &ldquo;Well, in the first place
Miss Webling is not Miss Webling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I am,&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt gasped, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to pretend
that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you read the will?&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says there that I was their daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll not quibble. Legally you may have been, but
actually you were their adopted child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis?&rdquo; said Marie Louise. &ldquo;And where did they find me?
Had you heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you force me to it, I must say that it is generally
believed that you were the natural daughter of Sir Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise was tremendously relieved by having something
that she could deny. She laughed with a genuineness
that swung the credulity all her way. She asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who was my mother&ndash;&ndash;my natural mother, could you
tell me? I really ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is believed to have been a&ndash;&ndash;a native of Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens! You don&rsquo;t mean a kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An actress playing in Vienna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am relieved! And Sir Joseph was my father&ndash;&ndash;yes.
Do go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether Sir Joseph was your father or not, he was born
in Germany and so was his wife, and they took a false oath
of allegiance to his Majesty. All the while they were loyal
only to the Kaiser. They worked for him, spied for him. It is
said that the Kaiser had promised to make Sir Joseph one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
of the rulers over England when he captured the island. Sir
Joseph was to have any castle he wanted and untold wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was I to have?&rdquo; Marie Louise was able to mock
her. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I to have at least Westminster Abbey to live
in? And one of the crown princes for a husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt lost her temper and her bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows what you were promised, but you did your
best to earn it, whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Prothero lost patience. &ldquo;Really, my dear Lady
Clifton-Wyatt, this is all getting beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt grew scarlet, too. She spoke with the
wrath of a Tisiphone whipping herself to a frenzy. &ldquo;I will
bring you proofs. This creature was a paid secret agent, a
go-between for Sir Joseph and the Wilhelmstrasse. She carried
messages. She went into the slums of Whitechapel disguised
as a beggar to meet the conspirators. She carried them
lists of ships with their cargoes, dates of sailing, destinations.
She carried great sums of money. She was the paymaster
of the spies. Her hands are red with the blood of British
sailors and women and children. She grew so bold that at last
she attracted the attention of even Scotland Yard. She was
followed, traced to Sir Joseph&rsquo;s home. It was found that she
lived at his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the spies, named Easling or Oesten, was her lover.
He was caught and met his deserts before a firing-squad in the
Tower. His confession implicated Sir Joseph. The police
raided his place. A terrific fight ensued. He resisted arrest.
He tried to shoot one of our police. The bullet went wild and
killed his wife. Before he could fire again he was shot down
by one of our men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonishing transformations the story had undergone
in its transit from gossip to gossip stunned Marie Louise. The
memory of the reality saddened her beyond laughter. Her
distress was real, but she had self-control enough to focus
it on Lady Clifton-Wyatt and murmur:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing, she is quite mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing that so nearly drives one insane as to be
accused of insanity.</p>
<p>The prosecutrix almost strangled on her indignation at
Marie Louise&rsquo;s calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The effrontery of this woman is unendurable, Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Prothero. If you believe her, you must permit me to leave.
I know what I am saying. I have had what I tell you from
the best authority. Of course, it may sound insane, but wait
until you learn what the German secret agents have been doing
in America for years and what they are doing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been publication enough of the sickening duplicity
of ambassadors and attach&eacute;s to lead the Americans to
believe that Teutonism meant anything revolting. Mrs.
Prothero was befuddled at this explosion in her quiet home.
She asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely all this has never been published, has it?
I think we should have heard of it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Lady Clifton-Wyatt. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
publish the accounts of the submarines we sink, do we? No
more do we tell the Germans what spies of theirs we have
captured. And, since Sir Joseph and his wife were dead, there
would have been no profit in publishing broadcast the story
of the battle. So they agreed to let it be known that they
died peacefully or rather painfully in their beds, of ptomaine
poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Prothero. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I read.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve always understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, curiously, as often happens in court, the discovery
that a witness has stumbled on one truth in a pack of lies
renders all he has said authentic and shifts the guilt to the
other side. Marie Louise could feel the frost of suspicion
against her forming in the air.</p>
<p>Polly made one more onset: &ldquo;But, tell me, Lady Clifton-Wyatt,
where was Marie Louise during all this Wild West
End pistol-play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her room with her lover,&rdquo; snarled Lady Clifton-Wyatt.
&ldquo;The servants saw her there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This threw a more odious light on Marie Louise. She was
not merely a nice clean spy, but a wanton.</p>
<p>Polly groaned: &ldquo;Tell that to Scotland Yard! I&rsquo;d never
believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotland Yard knows it without my telling,&rdquo; said Lady
Clifton-Wyatt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did Marie Louise come to escape and get to
America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because England did not want to shoot a woman, especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
not a young woman of a certain prettiness. So they let her
go, when she swore that she would never return to England.
But they did not trust her. She is under observation now!
Your home is watched, my dear Mrs. Widdicombe, and I
dare say there is a man on guard outside now, my dear Mrs.
Prothero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sent a chill along every spine. Marie Louise was
frightened out of her own brief bravado.</p>
<p>There was a lull in the trial while everybody reveled in
horror. Then Mrs. Prothero spoke in a judicial tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Miss Webling, please tell us your side of all this.
What have you to say in your own behalf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise&rsquo;s mouth suddenly turned dry as bark; her
tongue was like a dead leaf. She was inarticulate with remembrance
of her oath to Verrinder. She just managed to whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounded like an autumn leaf rasping across a stone.
Polly cried out in agony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie Louise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise shook her head and could neither think nor
speak. There was a hush of waiting. It was broken by the
voices of the men strolling in together. They were utterly
unwelcome. They stopped and stared at the women all
staring at Marie Louise.</p>
<p>Seeing Davidge about to ask what the tableau stood for, she
found voice to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Davidge, would you be so good as to take me home&ndash;&ndash;to
Mrs. Widdicombe&rsquo;s, that is. I&ndash;&ndash;I am a little faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted! I mean&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d be glad,&rdquo; he stammered,
eager to be at her service, yet embarrassed by the
sudden appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pardon me, Mrs. Prothero, for running away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Prothero, still dazed.</p>
<p>He bowed to her, and all round. Marie Louise nodded and
whispered, &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; and moved toward the door
waveringly. Davidge&rsquo;s heart leaped with pity for her.</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt checked him as he hurried past her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Davidge, I&rsquo;m stopping at the Shoreham. Won&rsquo;t
you drop in and have a cup of tea with me to-morrow at
hahf pahst fah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>The intended victim of Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s little lynching-bee
walked away, holding her head high. But she felt the
noose still about her neck and wondered when the rope would
draw her back and up.</p>
<p>Marie Louise marched through Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s hall in excellent
form, with just the right amount of dizziness to justify
her escape on the plea of sudden illness. The butler, like a
benign destiny, opened the door silently and let her out into
the open as once before in London a butler had opened a
door and let her into the welcome refuge of walls.</p>
<p>She gulped the cool night air thirstily, and it gave her courage.
But it gave her no wisdom. She had indeed got away
from Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s direct accusation of being a spy
and she had brought with her unscathed the only man whose
good opinion was important to her. But she did not know
what she wanted to do with him, except that she did not want
him to fall into Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s hands&ndash;&ndash;in which she
had left her reputation.</p>
<p>Polly Widdicombe would have gone after Marie Louise
forthwith, but Polly did not intend to leave her pet foewoman
in possession of the field&ndash;&ndash;not that she loved Marie Louise
more, but that she loved Lady Clifton-Wyatt less. Polly
was dazed and bewildered by Marie Louise&rsquo;s defection, but
she would not accept Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s version of this
story or of any other.</p>
<p>Besides, Polly gleaned that Marie Louise wanted to be
alone, and she knew that the best gift friendship can bestow
at times is solitude. The next best gift is defense
in absence. Polly announced that she would not permit
her friend to be traduced; and Lady Clifton-Wyatt, seeing
that the men had flocked in from the dining-room and
knowing that men always discount one woman&rsquo;s attack on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
another as mere cattiness, assumed her most angelic mien
and changed the subject.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As usual in retreats, the first problem was transportation.
Marie Louise found herself and Davidge outside Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s
door, with no means of getting to Rosslyn. She had
come in the Widdicombe car; Davidge had come in a hotel
cab and sent it away. Luckily at last a taxi returning to the
railroad terminal whizzed by. Davidge yelled in vain. Then
he put his two fingers to his mouth and let out a short blast
that brought the taxi-driver round. In accordance with the
traffic rules, he had to make the circuit of the big statue-crowned
circle in front of Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s home, one of those
numerous hubs that give Washington the effect of what some
one called &ldquo;revolving streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he drew up at the curb Davidge&rsquo;s first question
was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your gasolene supply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full up, boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise laughed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to spend another
night in a taxi with me, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge writhed at this deduction. He started to say,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to spend the rest of my life in a taxi with you.&rdquo;
That sounded a little too flamboyant, especially with a driver
listening in. So he said nothing but &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explained to the driver the route to Grinden Hall, and
they set forth.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had a dilemma of her own. Lady Clifton-Wyatt
had had the last word, and it had been an invitation
to Davidge to call on her. Worse yet, he had accepted it.
Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s purpose was, of course, to rob Marie
Louise of this last friend. Perhaps the wretch had a sentimental
interest in Davidge, too. She was a widow and a man-grabber;
she still had a tyrannic beauty and a greed of conquest.
Marie Louise was determined that Davidge should
not fall into her clutches, but she could hardly exact a promise
from him to stay away.</p>
<p>The taxi was crossing the aqueduct bridge before she could
brave the point. She was brazen enough to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
accept Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s invitation to tea, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;No American woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
can resist a lord; so how could an American man resist a
Lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This helpless syllable expressed another defeat for Marie
Louise. When they reached the house she bade him good
night without making any arrangement for a good morrow,
though Davidge held her hand decidedly longer than ever
before.</p>
<p>She stood on the portico and watched his cab drive off.
She gazed toward Washington and did not see the dreamy
constellation it made with the shaft of the Monument ghostly
luminous as if with a phosphorescence of its own. She felt
an outcast indeed. She imagined Polly hurrying back to
ask questions that could not be dodged any longer. She had
no right to defend herself offensively from the rightful demands
of a friend and hostess. Besides, the laws of hospitality
would not protect her from Polly&rsquo;s temper. Polly would have
a perfect right to order her from the house. And she would,
too, when she knew everything. It would be best to decamp
before being asked to.</p>
<p>Marie Louise whirled and sped into the house, rang for the
maid, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trunks! Please have them brought down&ndash;&ndash;or up,
from wherever they are, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your trunks, miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a taxicab. I shall have to leave at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;oh, I am sorry. Shall I help you pack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid went out with eyes popping, wondering what
earthquake had sent the guest home alone for such a headlong
exit.</p>
<p>Things flew in the drowsy house, and Marie Louise&rsquo;s chamber
looked like the show-room of a commercial traveler for a
linen-house when Polly appeared at the door and gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t know you were sick enough
to be delirious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came forward through an archipelago of clothes to
where Marie Louise was bending over a trunk. Polly took
an armload of things away from her and put them back in the
highboy. As she set her arms akimbo and stood staring at
Marie Louise with a lovable and loving insolence, she heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
the sound of a car rattling round the driveway, and her first
words were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming here at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the taxi for me,&rdquo; Marie Louise explained.</p>
<p>Polly turned to the maid, &ldquo;Go down and send it away&ndash;&ndash;no,
tell the driver to go to the asylum for a strait-jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid smiled and left. Marie Louise was afraid to
believe her own hopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you want me to stay, do you&ndash;&ndash;not after
what that woman said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine for a moment,&rdquo; returned Polly, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d
ever believe a word that cat could utter? Good Lord! if Lady
Clifton-Wyatt told me it was raining and I could see it was,
I&rsquo;d know it wasn&rsquo;t and put down my umbrella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise rejoiced at the trust implied, but she could
not make a fool of so loyal a friend. She spoke with difficulty:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if what she said was the truth, or, anyway, a kind
of burlesque of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie Louise!&rdquo; Polly gasped, and plounced into a chair.
&ldquo;Tell me the truth this minute, the true truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise was perishing for a confidante. She had gone
about as far without one as a normal woman can. She sat
wondering how to begin, twirling her rings on her fingers.
&ldquo;Well, you see&ndash;&ndash;you see&ndash;&ndash;it is true that I&rsquo;m not Sir Joseph&rsquo;s
daughter. I was born in a little village&ndash;&ndash;in America&ndash;&ndash;Wakefield&ndash;&ndash;out
there in the Middle West. I ran away from home,
and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, blanched, blushed, skipped over the years
she tried not to think of and managed never to speak of.
She came down to:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, at last I was in Berlin&ndash;&ndash;on the stage&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were an actress?&rdquo; Polly gasped.</p>
<p>Marie Louise confessed, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d hardly say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told Polly what she had told Mr. Verrinder of the appearance
of Sir Joseph and Lady Webling, of their thrill at
her resemblance to their dead daughter, of their plea that she
leave the stage and enter their family, of her new life, and
the outbreak of the war.</p>
<p>Major Widdicombe pounded on the door and said: &ldquo;Are
you girls going to talk all night? I&rsquo;ve got to get up at seven
and save the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>Polly cried to him, &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; and to Marie Louise, &ldquo;Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise began again, but just as she reached the first
suspicions of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s loyalty she remembered the oath
she had plighted to Verrinder and stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly groaned: &ldquo;Oh, my God! You&rsquo;re not going to stop
there! I loathe serials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise shook her head. &ldquo;If only I could tell you;
but I just can&rsquo;t! That&rsquo;s all; I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly turned her eyes up in despair. &ldquo;Well, I might as
well go to bed, I suppose. But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sleep a wink. Tell
me one thing, though. You weren&rsquo;t really a German spy,
were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Of course not! I loathe everything German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let the rest rest, then. So long as Lady Clifton-Wyatt
is a liar I can stand the strain. If you had been a
spy, I suppose I&rsquo;d have to shoot you or something; but so
long as you&rsquo;re not, you don&rsquo;t budge out of this house. Is
that understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise nodded with a pathetic gratitude, and Polly
stamped a kiss on her brow like a notarial seal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning&rsquo;s paper announced that spring had officially
arrived and been recognized at the Capitol&ndash;&ndash;a certain
Senator had taken off his wig. Washington accepted
this as the sure sign that the weather was warm. It would
not be officially autumn till that wig fell back into place.</p>
<p>There were less formal indications: for instance, the annual
flower-duel between the two terraces on Massachusetts
Avenue. The famous Embassy Terrace forsythias began it,
and flaunted little fringes of yellow glory. The slopes of the
Louise Home replied by setting their magnolia-trees on fire
with flowers like lamps, flowers that hurried out ahead of
their own leaves and then broke and covered the ground with
great petals of shattered porcelain. The Embassy Terrace
put out lamps of its own closer to the ground, but more gorgeous&ndash;&ndash;irises
in a row of blue, blue footlights.</p>
<p>The Louise Home, where gentlewomen of better days, ambassadresses
of an earlier r&eacute;gime, kept their state, had the last
word, the word that could not be bettered, for it uttered wistaria,
wistful lavender clusters weeping from the trellises in
languorous grace.</p>
<p>Marie Louise, looking from her open window in Rosslyn,
felt in the wind a sense of stroking fingers. The trees were
brisk with hope. The river went its way in a more sparkling
flow. The air blew from the very fountains of youth with a
teasing blarney. She thought of Ross Davidge and smiled
tenderly to remember his amiable earnestness. But she
frowned to remember his engagement with Lady Clifton-Wyatt.
She wondered what excuse she could invent to checkmate
that woman.</p>
<p>Suddenly inspiration came to her. She remembered that
she had forgotten to pay Davidge for the seat he surrendered
her in the chair-car. She telephoned him at his hotel. He
was out. She pursued him by wire travel till she found him
in an office of the Shipping Board. He talked on the corner of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
a busy man&rsquo;s desk. She heard the busy man say with a
taunting voice, &ldquo;A lady for you, Davidge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could hear the embarrassment in his voice. She was
in for it now, and she felt silly when she explained why she
bothered him. But she was stubborn, too. When he understood,
he laughed with the constraint of a man bandying enforced
gallantries on another man&rsquo;s telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be as honest as all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not honesty,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s selfishness. I
can&rsquo;t rest while the debt is on my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was perplexed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see several men on the
Shipping Board. There&rsquo;s a big fight on between the wooden-ship
fellows and the steel-ship men, and I&rsquo;m betwixt and between
&rsquo;em. I won&rsquo;t have time to run out to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of asking you. I was coming in to
town, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Well, then&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;when can I meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you say! The Willard at&ndash;&ndash;When shall you be
free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before four and then only for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Thank you ever so much. I&rsquo;ll buy me a lot of
steel with all that money you owe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise put up the receiver. People have got so
used to the telephone that they can see by it. Marie Louise
could visualize Davidge angry with embarrassment, confronting
the important man whose office he had desecrated with
this silly hammockese. She felt that she had made herself
a nuisance and lost a trick. She had taken a deuce with her
highest trump and had not captured the king.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to keep Davidge from meeting Lady Clifton-Wyatt
would be only to-day&rsquo;s battle. There would still be
to-morrows and the day-afters. Lady Clifton-Wyatt had
declared herself openly hostile to Marie Louise, and would
get her sooner or later. Flight from Washington would be
the only safety.</p>
<p>But Marie Louise did not want to leave Washington. She
loved Washington and the opportunities it offered a woman
to do important work in the cosmopolitan whirl of its populace.
But she could not live on at Polly Widdicombe&rsquo;s
forever.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>Marie Louise decided that her hour had struck. She must
find a nook of her own. And she would have to live in it all
by herself. Who was there to live with? She felt horribly
deserted in life. She had looked at numerous houses and
apartments from time to time. Apartments were costlier and
fewer than houses. Since she was doomed to live alone, anyway,
she might as well have a house. Her neighbors would
more easily be kept aloof.</p>
<p>She sought a real-estate agent, Mr. Hailstorks, of the sort
known as affable. But the dwellings he had to show were not
even that. Places she had found not altogether odious before
were rented now. Places that her heart went out to to-day
proved to have been rented yesterday.</p>
<p>Finally she ran across a residence of a sort. She sighed
to Mr. Hailstorks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a carpenter made it&ndash;&ndash;so let it pass for a house. I&rsquo;ll
take it if it has a floor. I&rsquo;m like Gelett Burgess: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t so
much care for a door, but this crawling around without
touching the ground is getting to be quite a bore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Hailstorks, bewilderedly.</p>
<p>He unlocked the door of somebody&rsquo;s tenantless ex-home
with its lonely furniture, and Marie Louise intruded, as one
does, on the chairs, rugs, pictures, and vases that other people
have been born with, have achieved, or have had thrust upon
them. She wondered, as one does, what sort of beings they
could have been that had selected such things to live among,
and what excuse they had had for them.</p>
<p>Mr. Hailstorks had a surprise in store for her. He led her
to the rear of the house and raised a shade. Instead of the
expectable back yard, Marie Louise was startled to see a noble
landscape leap into view. The house loomed over a precipitous
descent into a great valley. A stream ran far below, and
then the cliffs rose again opposite in a succession of uplifting
terraces that reminded her somehow of Richmond Hill superbly
built up above the silver Thames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is all that?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rock Creek Park, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Hailstorks, who had
a sincere real-estately affection for parks, since they raised
the price of adjoining property and made renting easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the price of all this grandeur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three hundred a month,&rdquo; said Mr. Hailstorks.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Only!&rdquo; gasped Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be four hundred in a week or two&ndash;&ndash;yes ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hailstorks.</p>
<p>So Marie Louise seized it before its price rose any farther.</p>
<p>She took a last look at Rock Creek Park, henceforth her
private game-preserve. As she stared, an idea came to her.
She needed one. The park, it occurred to her, was an excellent
wilderness to get lost in&ndash;&ndash;with Ross Davidge.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She was late to her meeting with Davidge&ndash;&ndash;not unintentionally.
He was waiting on the steps of the hotel, smoking,
when she drove up in the car she had bought for her Motor
Corps work.</p>
<p>He said what she hoped he would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you drove so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She quoted a popular phrase: &ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half
of it, dearie.&rsquo; Hop in, and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of Lady Clifton-Wyatt, and Marie Louise knew
he thought of her. But he was not hero or coward enough to
tell a woman that he had an engagement with another woman.
She pretended to have forgotten that he had told her, though
she could think of little else. She whisked round the corner of
I Street, or Eye Street, and thence up Sixteenth Street, fast
and far.</p>
<p>She was amazed at her own audacity, and Davidge could
not make her out. She had a scared look that puzzled him.
She was really thinking that she was the most unconscionable
kidnapper that ever ran off with some other body&rsquo;s child. He
could hardly dun her for the money, and she had apparently
forgotten it again.</p>
<p>They were well to the north when she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Rock Creek Park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never been in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a glimpse? I think it&rsquo;s the prettiest park
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her watch with that twist of the wrist now
becoming almost universal and gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I must turn back. But it&rsquo;s just about as short
to go through the park. I mustn&rsquo;t make you late to Lady
Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could find absolutely nothing to say to that except,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty pretty along here.&rdquo; She turned into Blagdon
Road and coasted down the long, many-turning dark glade.
At the end she failed to steer to the south. The creek
itself crossed the road. She drove the car straight through
its lilting waters. There was exhilaration in the splashing
charge across the ford. Then the road wound along the bank,
curling and writhing with it gracefully through thick forests,
over bridges and once more right through the bright flood.
The creek scrambling among its piled-up boulders was too
gay to suggest any amorous mood, and Marie Louise did
not quite dare to drive the car down to the water&rsquo;s edge at
any of the little green plateaus where picnics were being
celebrated on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always lose my way in this park,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I expect
I&rsquo;m lost now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to regret Davidge&rsquo;s approaching absence, with
a strange loneliness. He was becoming tenderly necessary to
her. She sighed, hardly meaning to speak aloud, &ldquo;Too bad
you&rsquo;re going away so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was startled to find that his departure meant something
to her. He spoke with an affectionate reassurance.</p>
<p>She stopped the car on a lofty plateau where several ladies
and gentlemen were exercising their horses at hurdle-jumping.
The &eacute;lan of rush, plunge and recovery could not excite Mamise
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. The next time I come to
Washington you drive me over to my shipyard and I&rsquo;ll show
you the new boat and the new yard for the rest of the flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be glorious. I should like to know something
about ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can teach you all I know in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know all there is to know, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord help us, I should say not! I knew a little about the
old methods, but they&rsquo;re all done away with. The fabricated
ship is an absolute novelty. The old lines are gone, and the
old methods. What few ship-builders we had are trying to
forget what they know. Everybody is green. We had to
find out for ourselves and pass it along to the foremen, and
they hand it out to the laborers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole art is in a confusion. There is going to be a
ghastly lot of mistakes and waste and scandal, but if we win
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
out there&rsquo;ll be such a cloudburst that the Germans will think
it&rsquo;s raining ships. Niagara Falls will be nothing to the cascade
of iron hulls going overboard. Von Tirpitz with his ruthless
policy will be like the old woman who tried to sweep the tide
back with a broom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grew so fervent in his vision of the new creation that he
hardly saw the riders as they stormed the hurdles. Marie
Louise took fire from his glow and forgot the petty motive
that had impelled her to bring him to this place. Suddenly he
realized how shamelessly eloquent he had been, and subsided
with a slump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bore I am to tell all this to a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose at that. &ldquo;The day has passed when a man can
apologize for talking business to a woman. I&rsquo;ve been in England
for years, you know, and the women over there are doing
all the men&rsquo;s work and getting better wages at it than the men
ever did. After the war they&rsquo;ll never go back to their tatting
and prattle. I&rsquo;m going to your shipyard and have a look-in,
but not the way a pink debutante follows a naval officer over
a battle-ship, staring at him and not at the works. I&rsquo;m going
on business, and if I like ship-building, I may take it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; he laughed, and slapped her hand where it lay on
the wheel. He apologized again for his roughness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive anything except an apology,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As she looked proudly down at the hand he had honored
with a blow as with an accolade she saw by her watch that
it was after six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens! it&rsquo;s six and more!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Lady
Clifton-Wyatt will never forgive you&ndash;&ndash;or me. I&rsquo;ll take you
to her at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind Lady Clifton-Wyatt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve
got another engagement for dinner&ndash;&ndash;with a man, at half past
six. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were drifting with the twilight into an elegiac mood,
suffering the sweet sorrow of parting.</p>
<p>The gloaming steeped the dense woods, and the romance of
sunset and gathering night saddened the business man&rsquo;s soul,
but wakened a new and unsuspected woman in Marie Louise.</p>
<p>Her fierce imaginations were suddenly concerned with conquests
of ambition, not of love. So fresh a realm was opened
to her that she was herself renewed and restored to that boyish-girlish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
estate of young womanhood before love has educated it
to desire and the slaveries of desire. The Aphrodite that lurks
in every woman had been put to flight by the Diana that is
also there.</p>
<p>Davidge on the other hand had warmed toward Marie
Louise suddenly, as he saw how ardent she could be. He had
known her till now only in her dejected and terrified, distracted
humors. Now he saw her on fire, and love began to blaze
within him.</p>
<p>He felt his first impulse to throw an arm about her and draw
her to his breast, but though the solitude was complete and the
opportunity perfect, he saw that she was in no spirit for
dalliance. There is no colder chaperon for a woman than a
new ambition to accomplish something worth while.</p>
<p>As they drew up at the New Willard she was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone the minute you come to town again. Good-by.
I&rsquo;m late to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She meant that she was late to life, late to a career.</p>
<p>Davidge stared at her in wonderment as she bent to throw
the lever into first speed. She roughed it in her impatience,
and the growl of the gear drowned the sound of another man&rsquo;s
voice calling her name. This man ran toward her, but she
did not notice him and got away before he could overtake her.</p>
<p>Davidge was jostled by him as he ran, and noted that he
called Miss Webling &ldquo;Mees Vapelink.&rdquo; The Teutonic intonation
did not fall pleasantly on the American ear at that time.
Washington was a forbidden city to Germanic men and soon
would banish the enemy women, too.</p>
<p>The stranger took refuge on the sidewalk, and his curses were
snarly with the Teutonic <i>r</i>. Davidge studied him and began
to remember him. He had seen him with Marie Louise
somewhere. Suddenly his mind, ransacking the filing-cabinet
of his memory, turned up a picture of Nicky Easton at the side
of Marie Louise at the dinner in Sir Joseph&rsquo;s home. He could
not remember the name, but a man has a ready label for anybody
he hates.</p>
<p>He began to worry now. Who was this spick foreigner who
ran hooting after her? It was not like Davidge to be either curious
or suspicious. But love was beginning its usual hocus-pocus
with character and turning a tired business man into a restless
swain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>Davidge resented Easton&rsquo;s claim on Marie Louise, whatever
it was, as an invasion of some imagined property right of his
own, or at least of some option he had secured somehow. He
was alarmed at the Teutonic accent of the interloper. He
began to take heed of how little he knew of Marie Louise,
after all. He recalled Sir Joseph Webling&rsquo;s German accent.
An icy fear chilled him.</p>
<p>His important business parley was conducted with an absent-mindedness
that puzzled his host, the eminent iron-master,
Jacob Cruit, who had exchanged an income of a
million a year and dictatorial powers for a governmental wage
of one dollar per annum, no authority, no gratitude, and endless
trouble.</p>
<p>Davidge&rsquo;s head was buzzing with thoughts in which Cruit
had no part:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can she be one of those horrible women who have
many lovers? Is she a woman of affairs? What is all this
mystery about her? What was she so afraid of the night she
would not stop at Mrs. Widdicombe&rsquo;s? Why was she so upset
by the appearance of Lady Clifton-Wyatt? Why was she in
such a hurry to get me away from Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s dinner,
and to keep me from keeping my engagement with Lady
Clifton-Wyatt? Why so much German association?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of dozens of explanations, most of them wild,
but none of them so wild as the truth&ndash;&ndash;that Marie Louise was
cowering under the accusation of being a German agent.</p>
<p>He resolved that he would forget Marie Louise, discharge
her from the employment of his thoughts. Yet that night
as he lay cooking in his hot berth he thought of Marie Louise
instead of ships. None of his riot of thoughts was so fantastic
as the fact that she was even then thinking of ships
and not of him.</p>
<p>That night Marie Louise ransacked the library that the
owner of Grinden Hall had left with the other furniture. Some
member of the family had been a cadet at Annapolis, and his
old text-books littered the shelves. Marie Louise selected and
bore away an armload, not of novels, but of books whose very
backs had repelled her before. They were the very latest romance
to her now.</p>
<p>The authors of <i>An Elementary Manual for the Deviation of
the Compass in Iron Ships</i>, <i>The Marine Steam-engine</i>, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
<i>An Outline of Ship-building</i>, <i>Theoretical and Practical</i>, could
hardly have dreamed that their works would one night go up-stairs
in the embrace of a young woman&rsquo;s arms. The books
would have struck a naval architect as quaintly old-fashioned,
but to Marie Louise they were as full of news as the latest
evening extra. The only one she could understand with ease
was Captain Samuels&rsquo;s <i>From the Forecastle to the Cabin</i>, and
she was thrilled by his account of the struggles of his youth,
his mutinies, his champion of the Atlantic, the semi-clipper
<i>Dreadnaught</i>, but most of all, by his glowing picture of the
decay of American marine glory.</p>
<p>She read till she could sit up no longer. Then she undressed
and dressed for sleep, snapped on the reading-lamp, and took
up another book, Bowditch&rsquo;s <i>American Navigation</i>. It was
the &ldquo;Revised Edition of 1883,&rdquo; but it was fresh sensation to
her. She lay prone like the reading Magdalen in the picture,
her hair pouring down over her shoulders, her bosom pillowed
on the volume beneath her eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Passengers arriving at Washington in the early morning
may keep their cubbyholes until seven, no later. By
half past seven they must be off the car. Jake Nuddle was an
ugly riser. He had always regarded the alarm-clock as the
most hateful of all the inventions of capitalists to enslave the
poor. Jake had strange ideas of capitalists, none stranger than
that they are luxurious persons who sleep late and knock off
work early.</p>
<p>Waking Jake was one of the most dangerous of his wife&rsquo;s
prerogatives. On this morning, if he had been awaker he would
have bitten off the black hand that reached into his berth and
twitched the sheet at seven of a non-working day. The voice
that murmured appealingly through the curtains, &ldquo;S&rsquo;em
o&rsquo;clock, please!&rdquo; did not please Jake at all.</p>
<p>He cursed his annoying and nudging wife a few times
heartily, then began to make his acutely unbeautiful toilet.
In the same small wheeled hotel capitalists, statesmen, matrons,
and misses were dressing in quarters just as strait.
Jake and his wife had always got in each other&rsquo;s way, but
never more cumbersomely than now. Jake found his wife&rsquo;s
stockings when he sought his socks. Her corset-strings seemed
to be everywhere. Whatever he laid hold of brought along
her corset. He thrust his head and arms into something
white and came out of it sputtering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your damned shimmy. Where&rsquo;s my damned
shirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow they made it at last, got dressed and washed
somehow and left the caravansary. Mrs. Nuddle carried the
heavier baggage. They had breakfast at the lunch-counter;
then they went out and looked at the Capitol. It inspired in
Jake&rsquo;s heart no national reverence. He said to his awestruck
wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where that gang of robbers, the Congersmen, meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
and agree on their hold-ups. They&rsquo;re all the hirelings of the
capitalists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They voted for this rotten war without consulting the
people. They didn&rsquo;t dare consult &rsquo;em. They knew the
people wasn&rsquo;t in favor of no such crime. But the Congersmen
get their orders from Wall Street, and them brokers wanted
the war because they owned so much stock that wouldn&rsquo;t be
worth the paper it was printed on unless the United States
joined the Allies and collected for &rsquo;em off Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thus that Jake and his kind regarded the avalanche of
horrific woe that German ambition spilled upon the world
and kept rolling down from the mountain-tops of heaped-up
munitions. It was thus that they contemplated the mangled
villages of innocent Belgium, the slavery-drives in the French
towns, the windrows of British dead, the increasing lust of
conquest, which grew by what it fed on, till at last America,
driven frantic by the endless carnage, took up belatedly the
gigantic task of throwing back the avalanche across the mountain
to the other side before it engulfed and ruined the world.
While Europe agonized in torments unthinkable, immeasurable,
and yet mysteriously endurable only because there was
no escape visible, the Jake Nuddles, illiterate and literate,
croaked their batrachian protest against capital, bewailed the
lot of imaginary working-men, and belied the life of real
working-men.</p>
<p>Staring at the Capitol, which means so much nobility to
him who has the nobility to understand the dream that raised
it, he burlesqued its ideals. Cruel, corrupt, lazy, and sloven
of soul, he found there what he knew best because it was his
own. Aping a sympathy he could not feel, he grew maudlin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they drag our poor boys from their homes in droves
and send &rsquo;em off to the slaughter-house in France&ndash;&ndash;all for
money! Anything to grind down the honest workman into
the dust, no matter how many mothers&rsquo; hearts they break!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake was one of those who never express sympathy for anybody
except in the course of a tirade against somebody else.
He had small use for wives, mothers, or children except as
clubs to pound rich men with. His wife, who knew him all
too well, was not impressed by his eloquence. Her typical answer
to his typical tirade was, &ldquo;I wonder how on earth we&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to find Mamise.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>Jake groaned at the anticlimax to his lofty flight, but he
realized that the main business before the house was what
his wife propounded.</p>
<p>He remembered seeing an Information Bureau sign in the
station. He had learned from the newspaper in which he had
seen Mamise&rsquo;s picture that she was visiting Major Widdicombe.
He had written the name down on the tablets of his
memory, and his first plan was to find Major Widdicombe.
Jake had a sort of wolfish cunning in tracing people he wanted
to meet. He could always find anybody who might lend him
money. He had mysterious difficulties in tracing some one
who could give him work.</p>
<p>He left his wife to simmer in the station while he set forth
on a scouting expedition. After much travel he found at last
the office of the Ordnance Department, in which Major Widdicombe
toiled, and he appeared at length at Major Widdicombe&rsquo;s
desk.</p>
<p>Jake was cautious. He would not state his purpose. He
hardly dared to claim relationship with Miss Webling until
he was positive that she was his sister-in-law. Noting Jake&rsquo;s
evasiveness, the Major discreetly evaded the request for his
guest&rsquo;s address. He would say no more than:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Webling is coming down to lunch with me at the&ndash;&ndash;that
is with my wife. I&rsquo;ll tell her you&rsquo;re looking for her; if
she wants to meet you, I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you come back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, mucher bliged,&rdquo; said Jake. Baffled and without
further recourse, he left the Major&rsquo;s presence, since there
seemed to be nothing else to do. But once outside, he felt that
there had been something highly unsatisfactory about the parley.
He decided to imitate Mary&rsquo;s little lamb and to hang
about the building till the Major should appear. In an hour or
two he was rewarded by seeing Widdicombe leave the door
and step into an automobile. Jake heard him tell the driver,
&ldquo;The Shoreham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake walked to the hotel and saw Marie Louise seated at
a table by a window. He recognized her by her picture and
was duly triumphant. He was ready to advance and demand
recognition. Then he realized that he could make no claim
on her without his awful wife&rsquo;s corroboration. He took a
street-car back to the station and found his nominal helpmeet
sitting just where he had left her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>Abbie had bought no newspaper, book, or magazine to
while away the time with. She was not impatient of idleness.
It was luxury enough just not to be warshin&rsquo; clo&rsquo;es, cookin&rsquo;
vittles, or wrastlin&rsquo; dishes. She took a dreamy content in
studying the majesty of the architecture, but her interest
in it was about that of a lizard basking on a fallen column in
a Greek peristyle. It was warm and spacious and nobody
disturbed her drowsy beatitude.</p>
<p>When Jake came and summoned her she rose like a rheumatic
old househound and obeyed her master&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Jake gave her such a vote of confidence as was implied in
letting her lug the luggage. It was cheaper for her to carry
it than for him to store it in the parcel-room. It caused the
fellow-passengers in the street-car acute inconvenience, but
Jake was superior to public opinion of his wife. In such a
homely guise did the fates approach Miss Webling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>The best place for a view is in one&rsquo;s back yard; then it is
one&rsquo;s own. If it is in the front yard, then the house
is only part of the public&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>In London Marie Louise had lived at Sir Joseph Webling&rsquo;s
home, its gray, fog-stained, smoked-begrimed front flush with
the pavement. But back of the house was a high-walled garden
with a fountain that never played. There was a great rug
of English-green grass, very green all winter and still greener
all summer. At an appropriate spot was a tree; a tea-table
sat under it; in blossom-time it sprinkled pink petals on the
garden hats of the women; and on the grass they fell, to twist
Tennyson, softlier than tired eyelids on tired eyes.</p>
<p>So Marie Louise adored her new home with its unpromising
entrance and its superb surprise from the rear windows.
When she broke the news to Polly Widdicombe, that she was
leaving her, they had a good fight over it. Yet Polly could
hardly insist that Marie Louise stay with her forever, especially
when Marie Louise had a perfectly good home of her own.</p>
<p>Polly went along for a morning of reconstruction work.
There were pictures, chairs, cushions, and knickknacks that
simply had to be hidden away. The original tenants evidently
had the theory that a bare space on a wall or a table
was as indecent as on a person&rsquo;s person.</p>
<p>They had taken crude little chromos and boxed them in
gaudy frames, many of whose atrocities were aggravated by
panels of plush of a color that could hardly be described by
any other name than fermented prune. Over the corner of
these they had thrown &ldquo;throws&rdquo; or drapes of malicious
magenta horribly figured in ruthless incompatibilities.</p>
<p>Chairs of unexplainable framework were upholstered with
fabrics of studied delirium. Every mantel was an exhibit
of models of what not to do. When Henry James said that
Americans had no end of taste, but most of it was bad, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
must have based his conclusions on such a conglomerate as
this.</p>
<p>Polly and Marie Louise found some of the furniture bad
enough to be amusing. But they toted a vanload of it into
closets and storerooms. Where the pictures came away they
left staring spaces of unfaded wall-paper. Still, they were
preferable to the pictures.</p>
<p>By noon the women were exhausted. They washed their
dust-smutted hands and faces and exclaimed upon the black
water they left. But the exercise had given them appetite,
and when Marie Louise locked the front door she felt all the
comfort of a householder. She had a home of her very own
to lock up, and though she had roamed through pleasures and
palaces, she agreed that, be it ever so horrible, there&rsquo;s no
place like home.</p>
<p>She and Polly were early to their luncheon engagement with
Major Widdicombe. Their appetites disputed the clock.
Polly decided to telephone her husband for Heaven&rsquo;s sake to
come at once to her rescue.</p>
<p>While Polly was telephoning Marie Louise sat waiting on
a divan. Her muscles were so tired that she grew nearly as
placidly animal as her sister in the Pennsylvania Station.
She was as different in every other way as possible. Her life,
her environment, her ambitions, had been completely alien
to anything Mrs. Nuddle had known. She had been educated
and evolved by entirely different joys and sorrows, fears and
successes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle had been afraid that her husband would beat
her again, or kill one of the children in his rage, or get himself
sent to prison or to the chair; Mrs. Nuddle had been afraid
that the children would be run over in the street, would pull
a boilerful of boiling water over onto them, or steal, or go
wrong in any of the myriad ways that children have of going
wrong. Mrs. Nuddle&rsquo;s ecstasies were a job well done, a word
of praise from a customer, a chance to sit down, an interval
without pain or worry when her children were asleep, or when
her husband was working and treating her as well as one
treats an old horse.</p>
<p>Of such was the kingdom of Mrs. Nuddle.</p>
<p>Marie Louise had dwelt in a world no more and no less
harrowing, but infinitely unlike. The two sisters were no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
longer related to each other by any ties except blood kinship.
Mrs. Nuddle was a good woman gone wrong, Marie Louise a
goodish woman gone variously; Mrs. Nuddle a poor advertisement
of a life spent in honest toil, early rising, early bedding,
churchgoing, and rigid economy; Marie Louise a most
attractive evidence of how much depends on a careful carriage,
a cultivated taste in clothes, and an elegant
acquaintance.</p>
<p>At last, after years of groping toward each other, the sisters
were to be brought together. But there was to be an intervention.
Even while Marie Louise sat relaxed in a fatigue
that she would have called contentment trouble was stealing
toward her.</p>
<p>The spider who came and sat beside this Miss Muffet was
Nicky Easton. He frightened her, but he would not let her
run away.</p>
<p>As he dropped to her side she rose with a gasp, but he
pressed her back with a hasty grip on her arm and a mandatory
prayer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait once, pleass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men who had shadowed Marie Louise had months
before given her up as hopelessly correct. But guardian
angels were still provided for Nicky Easton; and one of them,
seeing this meeting, took Marie Louise back into the select
coterie of the suspects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no cure for your bodily aches and pains like terror.
It lifts the paralytic from his bed, makes the lame scurry,
and gives the blind eyes enough for running. Marie Louise&rsquo;s
fatigue fell from her like a burden whose straps are slit.</p>
<p>When Nicky said: &ldquo;I could not find you in New York.
Now we are here we can have a little talkink,&rdquo; she stammered:
&ldquo;Not here! Not now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, pleass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an engagement&ndash;&ndash;a friend&ndash;&ndash;she has just gone to
telephone a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ashamed of me, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let him have it. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced at the slap in the face.</p>
<p>She went on: &ldquo;Besides, she knows you. Her husband is
an officer in the army. I can&rsquo;t talk to you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, then, and when?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Any time&ndash;&ndash;any place&ndash;&ndash;but here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time is no time. You tell me, or I stay now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to&ndash;&ndash;to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a howiss, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I just took it to-day. I shall be there this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;at
three, if you will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very goot. The address is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave it; he repeated it, mumbled, &ldquo;At sree o&rsquo;clock I am
there,&rdquo; and glided away just as Polly returned.</p>
<p>They were eating a consomm&eacute; madril&egrave;ne when the Major
arrived. He dutifully ate what his wife had selected for him,
and listened amiably to what she had to tell him about her
morning, though he was bursting to tell her about his.
Polly made a vivid picture of Marie Louise&rsquo;s new home, ending
with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything on God&rsquo;s earth in it except a piano and a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reminded Marie Louise of the books she had read on
ship-building, and she asked if she might borrow them. Polly
made a woeful face at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! When a woman starts to reading up on a subject
a man is interested in, she&rsquo;s lost&ndash;&ndash;and so is he. Beware
of it, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom demurred: &ldquo;Go right on, Marie Louise, so that you
can take an intelligent interest in what your husband is
working on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband!&rdquo; said Marie Louise. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you both a
trifle premature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly went glibly on: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to Tom, my dear.
What does he know about what a man wants his wife to take
an intelligent interest in? Once a woman knows about her
husband&rsquo;s business, he&rsquo;s finished with her and ready for the
next. Tom&rsquo;s been trying to tell me for ten years what he&rsquo;s
working at, and I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea yet. It always
gives him something to hope for. When he comes home of
evenings he can always say, &lsquo;Perhaps to-night&rsquo;s the night
when she&rsquo;ll listen.&rsquo; But once you listen intelligently and
really understand, he&rsquo;s through with you, and he&rsquo;ll quit you
for some pink-cheeked ignoramus who hasn&rsquo;t heard about it
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise, being a woman, knew how to get her message
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
to another woman; the way seems to be to talk right through
her talk. The acute creatures have ears to hear with and
mouths to talk with, and they apparently find no difficulty
in using both at the same time. Somewhere along about the
middle of Polly&rsquo;s discourse Marie Louise began to answer it
before it was finished. Why should she wait when she knew
what was coming? So she said contemporaneously and covocally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to marry a ship-builder, my dear.
Don&rsquo;t be absurd! I&rsquo;m not planning to take an intelligent
interest in Mr. Davidge&rsquo;s business. I&rsquo;m planning to take an
intelligent interest in my own. I&rsquo;m going to be a ship-builder
myself, and I want to learn the A B C&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They finished that argument at the same time and went on
together down the next stretch in a perfect team:</p>
<table summary='' width='100%'>
<tr>
<td valign='top'>
<p>"Oh, well of course, if that&rsquo;s the case," asserted Polly,
"then you&rsquo;re quite crazy&ndash;&ndash;unless you&rsquo;re simply hunting for a new
sensation. And on that score I&rsquo;ll admit that it sounds rather
interesting. I may take a whack at it myself. I&rsquo;m quite fed up on
bandages and that sort of thing. Get me a job in the same factory
or whatever they call it. Will you?"</p></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td valign='top'>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Davidge tells me,&rdquo; Marie Louise explained, &ldquo;that
women are needed in ship-building, and that anybody can learn. In
fact, everybody has to, anyway; so I&rsquo;ve got as good a chance as a
man. I&rsquo;m as strong as a horse. Fine! Come along, and we&rsquo;ll build a
U-boat chaser together. Mr. Davidge would be delighted to have
you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This was arrant hubbub to the mere man who was not
capable of carrying on a conversation except by the slow,
primitive methods of Greek drama, strophe and antistrophe,
one talking while the other listened, then <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>So he had time to remember that he had something to
remember, and to dig it up. He broke in on the dialogue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, that reminds me, Marie Louise. There&rsquo;s a
man in town looking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for me!&rdquo; Marie Louise gasped, alert as an antelope
at once. &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t seem to recall it. I&rsquo;ll have it in a minute. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
didn&rsquo;t impress me very favorably, so I didn&rsquo;t tell him you
were living with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly turned on Tom: &ldquo;Come along, you poor nut! I hate
riddles, and so does Marie Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; Tom cried. &ldquo;<i>Riddle&ndash;&ndash;Nuddle</i>. His name is
Nuddle. Do you know a man named Nuddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name conveyed nothing to Marie Louise except a suspicion
that Mr. Verrinder had chosen some pseudonym.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was his nationality?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! He was as Amurrican as a piece of
pungkin pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise felt a little relieved, but still at sea. When
Widdicombe asked what message he should take back her
curiosity led her to brave her fate and know the worst:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to come to my house at any time this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;no,
not before five. I have some shopping to do, and the
servants to engage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not ask Polly to go with her, and Polly took the hint
conveyed in Marie Louise&rsquo;s remark as they left the dining-room,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a little telephoning to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly went her way, and Marie Louise made a pretext of
telephoning.</p>
<p>Major Widdicombe did not see Jake Nuddle as he went
down the steps, for the reason that Jake saw him first and drew
his wife aside. He wondered what had become of Marie
Louise.</p>
<p>Jake and his wife hung about nonplussed for a few minutes,
till Marie Louise came out. She had waited only to make
sure that Tom and Polly got away. When she came down the
steps she cast a casual glance at Jake and her sister, who
came toward her eagerly. But she assumed that they were
looking at some one else, for they meant nothing to her eyes.</p>
<p>She had indeed never seen this sister before. The sister
who waddled toward her was not the sister she had left in
Wakefield years before. That sister was young and lean and
a maid. Marriage and hard work and children had swaddled
this sister in bundles of strange flesh and drawn the face in
new lines.</p>
<p>Marie Louise turned her back on her, but heard across her
shoulder the poignant call:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamise!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>That voice was the same. It had not lost its own peculiar
cry, and it reverted the years and altered the scene like a
magician&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abracadabra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise swung round just in time to receive the full
brunt of her sister&rsquo;s charge. The repeated name identified
the strange-looking matron as the girl grown old, and Marie
Louise gathered her into her arms with a fierce homesickness.
Her loneliness had found what it needed. She had kinfolk
now, and she sobbed: &ldquo;Abbie darling! My darling Abbie!&rdquo;
while Abbie wept: &ldquo;Mamise! Oh, my poor little Mamise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cluster of cab-drivers wondered what it was all about,
but Jake Nuddle felt triumphant. Marie Louise looked good
to him as he looked her over, and for the nonce he was content
to have the slim, round fashionable creature enveloped in his
wife&rsquo;s arms for a sister-in-law.</p>
<p>Abbie, a little homelier than ever with her face blubbery
and tear-drenched, turned to introduce what she had drawn
in the matrimonial lottery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamise!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want you should meet my husbin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted!&rdquo; said Mamise, before she saw her sister&rsquo;s
fate. She was thorough-trained if not thorough-born, and
she took the shock without reeling.</p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s hand was not as rough so it ought to have been,
and his cordiality was sincere as he growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleaster meecher, Mamise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was ready already with her first name, but she had
nothing to call him by. It never occurred to Abbie that her
sister would not instinctively know a name so familiar to
Mrs. Nuddle as Mr. Nuddle, and it was a long while before
Marie Louise managed to pick it up and piece it together.</p>
<p>Her embarrassment at meeting Jake was complete. She
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you living&ndash;&ndash;here in Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws, no!&rdquo; said Abbie; and that reminded her of the
bundles she had dropped at the sight of Mamise. They
had played havoc with the sidewalk traffic, but she hurried
to regain them.</p>
<p>Jake could be the gentleman when there was somebody
looking who counted. So he checked his wife with amazement
at the preposterousness of her carrying bundles while Sir
Walter Raleigh was at hand. He picked them up and brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
them to Marie Louise&rsquo;s feet, disgusted at the stupid amazement
of his wife, who did not have sense enough to conceal it.
Marie Louise was growing alarmed at the perfect plebeiance
of her kith. She was unutterably ashamed of herself for
noticing such things, but the eye is not to blame for what
it can&rsquo;t help seeing, nor the ear for what is forced upon it.
She had a feeling that the first thing to do was to get her
sister in out of the rain of glances from the passers-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come to me at once,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
taken a house. I&rsquo;ve got no servants in yet, and you&rsquo;ll have
to put up with it as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie gasped at the &ldquo;servants.&rdquo; She noted the authority
with which Marie Louise beckoned a chauffeur and pointed
to the bundles, which he hastened to seize.</p>
<p>Abbie was overawed by the grandeur of her first automobile
and showed it on her face. She saw many palaces on the
way and expected Marie Louise to stop at any of them.
When the car drew up at Marie Louise&rsquo;s home Abbie was
bitterly disappointed; but when she got inside she found her
dream of paradise. Marie Louise was distressed at Abbie&rsquo;s
loud praise of the general effect and her unfailing instinct for
picking out the worst things on the walls or the floors. This
distress caused a counter-distress of self-rebuke.</p>
<p>Jake was on his dignity at first, but finally he unbent
enough to take off his coat, hang it over a chair, and stretch
himself out on a divan whose ulterior maroon did not disturb
his repose in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I call something like,&rdquo; he said; and then,
&ldquo;And now, Mamise, set in and tell us all about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the last thing Mamise wanted to do, and she
evaded with a plea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can wait. I want to hear all about you, Abbie darling.
How are you, and how long have you been married, and
where do you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; on eight years come next October, and we got three
childern. I been right poorly lately. Don&rsquo;t seem to take
as much interest in worshin&rsquo; as I useter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washing!&rdquo; Marie Louise exclaimed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wash,
do you? That is, I mean to say&ndash;&ndash;professionally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I worsh. Do right smart of work, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise was overwhelmed. She had a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
thousand dollars, and her sister was a&ndash;&ndash;washerwoman! It
was intolerable. She glanced at Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr.&ndash;&ndash;your husband&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jake, he works&ndash;&ndash;off and on. But he ain&rsquo;t got what
you might call a hankerin&rsquo; for it. He can take work or let it
alone. I can&rsquo;t say as much for him when it comes to licker.
Fact is, some the women say, &lsquo;Why, Mrs. Nuddle, how do
you ever&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t Nuddle, is it?&rdquo; Marie Louise
broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is. What did you think it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the sleeping brother-in-law was the mysterious inquirer.
That solved one of her day&rsquo;s puzzles and solved it very tamely.
So many of life&rsquo;s mysteries, like so many of fiction&rsquo;s, peter
out at the end. They don&rsquo;t sustain.</p>
<p>Marie Louise still belonged to the obsolescent generation
that believed it a husband&rsquo;s duty to support his wife by his
own labor. The thought of her sister supporting a worthless
husband by her own toil was odious. The first task was to
get Jake to work. It was only natural that she should think
of her own new mania.</p>
<p>She spoke so eagerly that she woke Jake when she said:
&ldquo;I have it! Why doesn&rsquo;t your husband go in for ship-building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise told him about Davidge and what Davidge
had said of the need of men. She was sure that she could get
him a splendid job, and that Mr. Davidge would do anything
for her.</p>
<p>Jake was about to rebuke such impudence as it deserved,
but a thought struck him, and he chewed it over. Among
the gang of idealists he consorted with, or at least salooned
with, the dearest ambition of all was to turn America&rsquo;s dream
of a vast fleet of ships into a nightmare of failure. In order
to secure &ldquo;just recognition&rdquo; for the workman they would
cause him to be recognized as both a loafer and a traitor&ndash;&ndash;that
was their ideal of labor.</p>
<p>As Marie Louise with unwitting enthusiasm rhapsodized
over the shipyard Jake&rsquo;s interest kindled. To get into a shipyard
just growing, and spread his doctrines among the men
as they came in, to bring off strikes and to play tricks with
machinery everywhere, to wreck launching-ways so that hulls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
that escaped all other attacks would crack through and stick&ndash;&ndash;it
was a Golconda of opportunities for this modern conquistador.
He could hardly keep his face straight till he heard
Marie Louise out. He fooled her entirely with his ardor;
and when he asked, &ldquo;Do you think your gentleman friend,
this man Davidge, would really give me a job?&rdquo; she cried,
with more enthusiasm than tact:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he would. He&rsquo;d give anybody a job. Besides,
I&rsquo;m going to take one myself. And, Abbie honey, what
would you say to your becoming a ship-builder, too? It
would be immensely easier and pleasanter than washing
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Abbie could recover the breath she lost at the picture
of herself as a builder of ships the door-bell rang. Abbie
peeked and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose it&rsquo;s that feller Davidge?&rdquo; said Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;somebody else,&rdquo; said Marie Louise, who
knew who it was without looking.</p>
<p>She was at her wit&rsquo;s end now. Nicky Easton was at the
door, and a sister and a brother-in-law whose existence she
had not suspected were in the parlor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>If anything is anybody&rsquo;s very own, it is surely his past, or
hers&ndash;&ndash;particularly hers. But Nicky Easton was bringing
one of the most wretched chapters of Marie Louise&rsquo;s past to
her very door. She did not want to reopen it, especially not
before her new-found family. One likes to have a few illusions
left for these reunions. So she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abbie darling, would you forgive me if I saw this&ndash;&ndash;person
alone? Besides, you&rsquo;ll be wanting to get settled in your room,
if Mr.&ndash;&ndash;Ja&ndash;&ndash;your husband doesn&rsquo;t mind taking your things
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie had not been used to taking dismissals graciously.
She had never been to court and been permitted to retire.
Besides, people who know how to take an eviction gracefully
usually know enough to get out before they are put out. But
Abbie had to be pushed, and she went, heartbroken, disgraced,
resentful. Jake sulked after her. They moved
like a couple of old flea-bitten mongrels spoken to sharply.</p>
<p>And of course they stole back to the head of the stairs and
listened.</p>
<p>Nicky had his face made up for a butler, or at least a maid.
When he saw Marie Louise he had to undo his features, change
his opening oration, and begin all over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is zhoo yourself, then,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come in, do. I have no servants yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cooed, encouraged at once.</p>
<p>She squelched his hopes. &ldquo;My sister and her husband are
here, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This astounded him so that he spoke in two languages at
once: &ldquo;Your schwister! Since how long do you have a sester?
And where did you get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always had her, but we haven&rsquo;t seen each other for
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gasped, &ldquo;<i>Was Sie nicht sagen</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind not talking German&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Recht so</i>. Excuse. Do I come in&ndash;&ndash;no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped back, and he went into the drawing-room. He
smiled at what he saw, and was polite, if cynical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rent foornished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved her to a chair so that he might sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Was giebt&rsquo;s neues</i>&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;what is the noose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none. What is yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you do not wish to tell. If I should commence
once, I should never stop. But we are both alife yet. That
is always somethink. I was never so nearly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise could not withhold the protest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved yourself by betraying your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I telled&ndash;&ndash;I told only what the English knew already.
If they let me go for it, it was no use to kill everybody,
should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was rather miserable about it, for he could see that she
despised him more for being an informer than for having
something to inform. He pleaded in extenuation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall show how usefool I can be to my country.
Those English shall be sorry to let me go, and my people glad.
And so shall you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied him, and dreaded him, loathing his claim
on her, longing to order him never to speak again to her, yet
strangely interested in his future power for evil. The thought
occurred to her that if she could learn his new schemes she
might thwart them. That would be some atonement for
what she had not prevented before. This inspiration brightened
her so suddenly and gave such an eagerness to her manner
that he saw the light and grew suspicious&ndash;&ndash;a spy has to be,
for he carries a weapon that has only one cartridge in it.</p>
<p>Marie Louise waited for him to explain his purpose till the
suspense began to show; then she said, bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mischief are you up to now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mitschief&ndash;&ndash;me?&rdquo; he asked, all innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you wanted to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always want to see you. You interest&ndash;&ndash;my eyes&ndash;&ndash;my
heart&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She said it with the effect of slamming a
door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>She looked him full in the eyes angrily, then remembered
her curiosity. He saw her gaze waver with a double motive.</p>
<p>It is strange how people can fence with their glances, as
if they were emanations from the eyes instead of mere reflections
of light back and forth. But however it is managed,
this man and this woman played their stares like two foils
feeling for an opening. At length he surrendered and resolved
to appeal:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel about&ndash;&ndash;about us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not Germans. I&rsquo;m American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then England is your greater enemy than Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to smile at that, but she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pleaded for his cause. &ldquo;America ought not to have joined
the war against the <i>Vaterland</i>. It is only a few Americans&ndash;&ndash;bankers
who lended money to England&ndash;&ndash;who wish to fight us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up-stairs Jake&rsquo;s heart bounded. Here was a fellow-spirit.
He listened for Marie Louise&rsquo;s response; he caught the doubt
in her tone. She could not stomach such an absurdity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It sounded like &ldquo;Boche!&rdquo; And Nicky flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been in this Washington town too long. I
think I shall go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise made no objection. She had not found out
what he was up to, but she was sick of duplicity, sick of the
sight of him and all he stood for. She did not even ask him
to come again. She went to the door with him and stood
there a moment, long enough for the man who was shadowing
Nicky to identify her. She watched Nicky go and hoped that
she had seen the last of him. But up-stairs the great heart
of Jake Nuddle was seething with excitement. He ran to the
front window, caught a glimpse of Nicky, and hurried back
down the stairs.</p>
<p>Abbie called out, &ldquo;Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake did not answer such a meddlesome question, but he
said to Marie Louise, as he brushed past her on the stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the drug-store to git me some cigars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky paused on the curb, looking for a cab. He had dismissed
his own, hoping to spend a long while with Marie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Louise. He saw that he was not likely to pick up a cab in
such a side-street, and so he walked on briskly.</p>
<p>He was furious with Marie Louise. He had had hopes of
her, and she had fooled him. These Americans were no
longer dependable.</p>
<p>And then he heard footsteps on the walk, quick footsteps
that spelled hurry. Nicky drew aside to let the speeder pass;
but instead he heard a constabular &ldquo;Hay!&rdquo; and his shoulder-blades
winced.</p>
<p>It was only Jake Nuddle. Jake had no newspaper to sell,
but he had an idea for a collaboration which would bring him
some of that easy money the Germans were squandering like
drunken sailors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was just talkin&rsquo; to my sister-in-law,&rdquo; said Jake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are then the brother of Marie Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, and I couldn&rsquo;t help hearin&rsquo; a little of what passed
between you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s slyness had a detective-like air in Nicky&rsquo;s anxious
eyes. He warned himself to be on guard. Jake said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for Germany unanimous. I think it&rsquo;s a rotten shame
for America to go into this war. And some of us Americans
are sayin&rsquo; we won&rsquo;t stand for it. We don&rsquo;t own no Congersmen;
we&rsquo;re only the protelarriat, as the feller says; but we&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo; to put this country on the bum, and that&rsquo;s what old
Kaiser Bill wants we should do, or I miss my guess, hay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky was cautious:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you propose to help the All Highest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sabotodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interest me,&rdquo; said Nicky.</p>
<p>They had come to one of the circles that moon the plan of
Washington. Nicky motioned Jake to a bench, where they
could command the approach and be, like good children, seen
and not heard. Jake outlined his plan.</p>
<p>When Nicky Easton had rung Marie Louise&rsquo;s bell he had not
imagined how much help Marie Louise would render him in
giving him the precious privilege of meeting her unprepossessing
brother-in-law; nor had she dreamed what peril she was
preparing for Davidge in planning to secure for him and his
shipyard the services of this same Jake, as lazy and as
amiable as any side-winder rattlesnake that ever basked in
the sunlit sand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Davidge despised a man who broke his contracts. He
broke one with himself and despised himself. He broke
his contract to ignore the existence of Marie Louise. The
next time he came to Washington he sought her out. He
called up the Widdicombe home and learned that she had
moved. She had no telephone yet, for it took a vast amount
of time to get any but a governmental telephone installed.
So he noted her address, and after some hesitation decided
to call. If she did not want to see him, her butler could
tell him that she was out.</p>
<p>He called. Marie Louise had tried in vain to get in servants
who would stay. Abbie talked to them familiarly&ndash;&ndash;and so
did Jake. The virtuous ones left because of Jake, and the
others left because of Abbie.</p>
<p>So Abbie went to the door when Davidge called. He supposed
that the butler was having a day off and the cook
was answering the bell. He offered his card to Abbie.</p>
<p>She wiped her hand on her apron and took it, then handed
it back to him, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to read it. I ain&rsquo;t my specs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge said, &ldquo;Please ask Miss Webling if she can see
Mr. Davidge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Mr. Davidge!&rdquo; Abbie gasped, remembering
the importance Marie Louise gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Davidge, with proper modesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie wiped her hand again and thrust it forward, seizing
his questioning fingers in a practised clench, and saying,
&ldquo;Come right on in and seddown.&rdquo; She haled the befuddled
Davidge to a chair and regarded him with beaming eyes. He
regarded her with the eyes of astonishment&ndash;&ndash;and the ears, too,
for the amazing servant, forever wiping her hands, went to
the stairs and shrieked:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mamee-eese! Oh, Ma-mee-uz! Mist&rsquo; Davidge is shere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mamise! She had to come down upon such a scene,
and without having had any chance to break the news that
she had a sister she had to introduce the sister. She had
no chance to explain her till a fortunate whiff of burning
pastry led Abbie to groan, &ldquo;My Lord, them pies!&rdquo; and flee.</p>
<p>If ever Marie Louise had been guilty of snobbery, she was
doing penance for it now. She was too loyal to what her
family ought to have been and was not to apologize for
Abbie, but she suffered in a social purgatory.</p>
<p>Worse yet, she had to ask Davidge to give her brother-in-law
a job. And Davidge said he would. He said it before
he saw Jake. And when he saw him, though he did not like
him, he did not guess what treachery the fellow planned.
He invited him to come to the shipyard&ndash;&ndash;by train.</p>
<p>He invited Mamise to ride thither in her own car the next
day to see his laboratory for ships, never dreaming that the
German menace was already planning its destruction.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Not only in cheap plays and farces do people continue in
perplexities that one question and one answer would put an
end to. In real life we incessantly dread to ask the answers
to conundrums that we cannot solve, and persist in misery
for lack of a little frankness.</p>
<p>For many a smiling mile, on the morrow, Davidge rode in a
torment. So stout a man, to be fretted by so little a matter!
Yet he was unable to bring himself to the point of solving
his curiosity. The car had covered forty miles, perhaps,
while his thoughts ran back and forth, lacing the road like a
dog accompanying a carriage. A mental speedometer would
have run up a hundred miles before he made the plunge and
popped the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamise is an unusual name,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was pleasantly startled by the realization that
his long silence had been devoted to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet.&rdquo; The youthfulness of this embarrassed him and
made her laugh. He grew solemn for about eleven hundred
yards of road that went up and down and up and down in
huge billows. Then he broke out again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an unusual name.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>She laughed patiently. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road shot up a swirling hill into an old, cool grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only knew one other&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Mamise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sobered her. It was unpleasant not to be unique.
The chill woods seemed to be rather glum about it, too.
The road abandoned them and flung into a sun-bathed plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? You really knew another&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Mamise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She was sorry about that, too. The road slipped
across a loose-planked, bone-racking bridge. With some
jealousy she asked, &ldquo;What was she like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd.&rdquo; A little shabby, topply-tombed graveyard
glided by, reverting to oblivion. &ldquo;Tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A big motor charged past so fast that the passengers were
only blurs, a grim chauffeur-effect with blobs of fat womankind
trailing snapping veils. The car trailed a long streamer
of dust that tasted of the road. When this was penetrated
they entered upon a stretch of pleasant travel for eyes and
wheels, on a long, long channel through a fruitful prairie, a
very allegory of placid opulence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was funny,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;I was younger than I am.
I went to a show one night. A musical team played that
everlasting &lsquo;Poet and Peasant&rsquo; on the xylophones. They
played nearly everything on nearly everything&ndash;&ndash;same old
stuff, accordions, horns, bells; same old jokes by the same fool
clown and the solemn dubs. But they had a girl with &rsquo;em&ndash;&ndash;a
young thing. She didn&rsquo;t play very well. She had a way
with her, though&ndash;&ndash;seemed kind of disgusted with life and the
rest of the troupe and the audience. And she had a right
to be disgusted, for she was as pretty as&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know what.
She was just beautiful&ndash;&ndash;slim and limber and long&ndash;&ndash;what you
might imagine a nymph would look like if she got loose in a
music-hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was crazy about her. If I could ever have written a
poem about anybody, it would have been about her. She
struck me as something sort of&ndash;&ndash;well, divine. She wore the
usual, and not much of it&ndash;&ndash;low neck, bare arms, and&ndash;&ndash;tights.
But I kind of revered her; she was so dog-on pretty.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When the drop fell on that act I was lost. I was an orphan
for true. I couldn&rsquo;t rest till I saw the manager and asked him
to take me back and introduce me to her. He gave me a nasty
grin and said he didn&rsquo;t run that kind of a theater, and I said
I&rsquo;d knock his face off if he thought I thought he did. Well,
he gave in finally and took me back. I fell down the side-aisle
steps and sprawled along the back of the boxes and stumbled
up the steps to the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I met Mamise&ndash;&ndash;that was her name on the program&ndash;&ndash;Mamise.
She was pretty and young as ever, but she
wasn&rsquo;t a nymph any longer. She was just a young, painted
thing, a sulky, disgusted girl. And she was feeding a big
monkey&ndash;&ndash;a chimpanzee or something. It was sitting on a
bicycle and smoking a cigar&ndash;&ndash;getting ready to go on the
stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so human and so unhuman and so ugly, and she was
so graceful, that it seemed like a sort of satire on humanity.
The manager said, &lsquo;Say, Mamise, this gentleman here wants
to pays his respecks.&rsquo; She looked up in a sullen way, and the
chimpanzee showed his teeth at me, and I mumbled something
about expecting to see the name Mamise up in the big
electric lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave me a look that showed she thought I was a darned
fool, and I agreed with her then&ndash;&ndash;and since. She said, &lsquo;Much
obliged&rsquo; in a contemptuous contralto and&ndash;&ndash;and turned to the
other monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interview was finished. I backed over a scene-prop,
knocked down a stand of Indian-clubs, and got out into the
alley. I was mad at her at first, but afterward I always
respected her for snubbing me. I never saw her again, never
saw her name again. As for the big electric lights, I was
a punk prophet. But her name has stood out in electric
lights in my&ndash;&ndash;my memory. I suppose she left the stage soon
after. She may be dead now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hurt me a lot to have her wither me with that one big,
slow glance of hers, but I was glad of it afterward. It made
me feel more comfortable about her. If she had welcomed
every stranger that came along she&ndash;&ndash;well, as she didn&rsquo;t,
she must have been a good girl, don&rsquo;t you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road still pierced the golden scene, a monotony of
plenty, an endless-seeming treasure of sheaves of wheat and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
stacks of corn, with pumpkins of yellow metal and twisted
ingots of squash; but an autumnal sorrow clouded the landscape
for Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call a good girl?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hard question to answer nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because our ideas of good are so much more merciful
and our ideas of girls are so much more&ndash;&ndash;complicated. Anyway,
as the fellow said, that&rsquo;s my story. And now you know
all about Mamise that I know. Can you forgive her for
wearing your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could forgive that Mamise anything,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;But
this Mamise I can&rsquo;t forgive at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This puzzled him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite get that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let him simmer in his own perplexity through a furlong
of what helpless writers call &ldquo;a shady dell&rdquo;; its tenderness
won from him a timid confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reminded me of her when I first met you. You are
as different as can be, and yet somehow you remind me of
each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow we are each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward and stared at her, and she spared him
a hasty glance from the road. She was blushing.</p>
<p>He was so childishly happy that he nearly said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small
world, after all.&rdquo; He nearly swung to the other extreme.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He settled like a dying pendulum on,
&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;well!&rdquo; They both laughed, and he put out his hand.
&ldquo;Pleased to meet you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She let go the wheel and pressed his hand an instant.</p>
<p>The plateau was ended, and the road went overboard in a
long, steep cascade. She pushed out the clutch and coasted.
The whir of the engine stopped. The car sailed softly.</p>
<p>He was eager for news of the years between then and now.
It was so wonderful that the surly young beginner in vaudeville
should have evolved into this orchid of the salons. He
was interested in the working of such social machinery. He
urged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened to you after I saw you? You don&rsquo;t
remember me, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember the monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both laughed at the unconscious brutality of this. He
turned solemn and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that so many men came back to call on
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not so many&ndash;&ndash;too many, but not many. But&ndash;&ndash;well,
the monkey was more unusual, I suppose. He traveled with
us several weeks. He was very jealous. He had a fight with
a big trained dog that I petted once. They nearly killed each
other before they could be separated. And such noises as they
made! I can hear them yet. The manager of the monkey
wanted to marry me. I was unhappy with my team, but I
hated that man&ndash;&ndash;he was such a cruel beast with the monkey
that supported him. He&rsquo;d have beaten me, too, I suppose, and
made me support him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge sighed with relief as if her escape had been just
a moment before instead of years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t marry him! But tell me what
did happen after I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road led them into a sizable town, street-car tracks,
bad pavements, stupid shops, workmen&rsquo;s little homes in rows
like chicken-houses, then better streets, better homes, business
blocks well paved, a hotel, a post-office, a Carnegie library, a
gawky Civil War statue, then poorer shops, rickety pavements,
shanties, and the country again.</p>
<p>Davidge noted that she had not answered his question. He
repeated it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened after you and the monkey-trainer parted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, years later I was in Berlin with a team called the
Musical Mokes, and Sir Joseph and Lady Webling saw me
and thought I looked like their daughter, and they adopted
me&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had grown a bit weary of her autobiography. Abbie
had made her tell it over and over, but had tried in vain to
find out what went on between her stage-beginnings and her
last appearance in Berlin.</p>
<p>Davidge was fascinated by her careless summary of such
great events; for to one in love, all biography of the beloved
becomes important history. But having seen her as a member
of Sir Joseph&rsquo;s household, he was more interested in the
interregnum.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But between your reaching Berlin and the time I saw you
what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw him wince at the abrupt discourtesy of this. She
apologized:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, but&ndash;&ndash;well, it wouldn&rsquo;t interest
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, it would. Don&rsquo;t tell me if you don&rsquo;t want to,
but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll think that if I don&rsquo;t tell you it&rsquo;s because
I&rsquo;m ashamed to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, at all. Well, what if I were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine your having done anything to be ashamed
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord! Am I as stupid as that comes to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! But I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t have done anything to be
really ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean. I&rsquo;ve done numberless things I&rsquo;d
give my right arm not to have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean really wicked things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;well, I mean being bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman-bad or man-bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad for a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s bad for one is not bad for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, but there is a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I told you that I had been very, very wicked in those
mysterious years, would it seem important to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! Horribly! It couldn&rsquo;t help it, if a man cared
much for a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if a woman cared a lot for a man, ought it to make
a difference what he had done before he met her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course&ndash;&ndash;but that&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men say &lsquo;Because!&rsquo; too, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just shorthand with us. It means you know it so well
there&rsquo;s no need of explaining.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Well, if you&ndash;&ndash;I say, <i>if</i> you were very much in love
with me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be odiously polite. I&rsquo;m arguing, not fishing. If
you were deeply in love with me, would it make a good deal of
difference to you if several years ago I had been&ndash;&ndash;oh, loose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would break my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise liked him the better for this, but she held
to her argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now, still supposing that we loved each other,
ought I to inquire of you if the man of my possible choice
had been perfectly&ndash;&ndash;well, spotless, all that time? Ought
I expect that he was saving himself up for me, feeling himself
engaged to me, you might say, long before he met me, and
keeping perfectly true to his future fianc&eacute;e&ndash;&ndash;ought I to expect
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed a little as he mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed a trifle bitterly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re there already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the double standard. What&rsquo;s crime for the goose is
pastime for the gander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not intend to give up man&rsquo;s ancient prerogative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s better to have almost any standard than none,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The single standard is better than the sixteen to one&ndash;&ndash;silver
for men and gold for women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps! But you men seem to believe in a sixteen to
none. Mind you, I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ve been bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you couldn&rsquo;t have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I could have been&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not saying I wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m
not saying anything at all. I&rsquo;m saying that it&rsquo;s nobody&rsquo;s
business but my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even your future husband has no right to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever. He has the least right of all, and he&rsquo;d
better not try to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You women are changing things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to, if we&rsquo;re going to live among men. When
you&rsquo;re in Rome&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to turn the world upside down, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always done that more or less, and nobody ever
could stop us, from the Garden of Eden on. In the future,
one thing is sure: a lot of women will go wrong, as the saying
is, under the new conditions, with liberty and their own
money and all. But, good Lord! millions of women went
wrong in the old days! The first books of the Bible tell about
all the kinds of wickedness that we know to-day. Somebody
complained that with all our modern science we hadn&rsquo;t invented
one new deadly sin. We go on using the same old
seven&ndash;&ndash;well, indecencies. It will be the same with women.
It&rsquo;s bound to be. You can&rsquo;t keep women unfree. You&rsquo;ve
simply got to let them loose. The old ways were hideous; and
it&rsquo;s dishonest and vicious to pretend that people used to be
better than they were, just as an argument in favor of slavery,
for fear they will be worse than the imaginary woman they put
up for an argument. I fancy women were just about as good
and just about as bad in old Turkey, in the jails they call
harems, as they are in a three-ringed circus to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the old-fashioned woman went wrong she lied or
cried or committed suicide or took to the streets or went on
with her social success, as the case might be. She&rsquo;ll go on doing
much the same&ndash;&ndash;just as men do. Some men repent, some
cheat, some kill themselves; others go right along about their
business, whether it&rsquo;s in a bank, a church, a factory, a city or
a village or anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the new marriage&ndash;&ndash;for marriage is really changing,
though the marrying people are the same old folks&ndash;&ndash;in the
new marriage a man must do what a woman has had to do
all along: take the partner for better or worse and no questions
asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He humored her heresy because he found it too insane to
reason with. &ldquo;In other words, we&rsquo;ll take our women as is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the expression&ndash;&ndash;<i>as is</i>. A man will take his sweetheart
&lsquo;as is&rsquo; or leave her. And whichever he does, as you
always say, oh, she&rsquo;ll get along somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old-fashioned home goes overboard, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on what you mean by the old-fashioned
home. I had one, and it could well be spared. There were all
kinds of homes in old times and the Middle Ages and nowadays,
and there&rsquo;ll be all kinds forever. But we&rsquo;re wrangling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
like a pair of lovers instead of getting along beautifully like a
pair of casual acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to be more than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not. I want a place on your pay-roll; I&rsquo;m not
asking for a job as your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I have another engagement. When I have
made my way in the world and can support you in the style
you&rsquo;re accustomed to, I may come and ask for your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her flippancy irked him worse than her appalling ideas, but
she grew more desirable as she grew more infuriating, for
the love-game has some resemblances to the fascinating-sickening
game of golf. She did not often argue abstrusely,
and she was already fagged out mentally. She broke off the
debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s think of something else, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked of everything else, but his soul was chiefly
engaged in alternating vows to give her up and vows to make
her his own in spite of herself; and he kept on trying to
guess the conundrum she posed him in refusing to enlighten
him as to those unmentionable years between his first sight of
her and his second.</p>
<p>In making love, as in other popular forms of fiction, the
element of mystery is an invaluable adjunct to the property
value. He was still pondering her and wondering what she
was pondering when they reached the town where his
shipyard lay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>From a hilltop Marie Louise saw below her in panorama
an ugly mess of land and riverscape&ndash;&ndash;a large steel shed,
a bewilderment of scaffolding, then a far stretch of muddy
flats spotted with flies that were probably human beings,
among a litter of timber, of girders, of machine-shanties, of
railroad tracks, all spread out along a dirty water.</p>
<p>A high wire fence surrounded what seemed to need no protection.
In the neighborhood were numbers of workmen&rsquo;s
huts&ndash;&ndash;some finished, and long rows of them in building, as
much alike and as graceful as a pan of raw biscuits.</p>
<p>She saw it all as it was, with a stranger&rsquo;s eyes. Davidge
saw it with the eyes a father sees a son through, blind to
evident faults, vividly accepting future possibilities as realities.</p>
<p>Davidge said, with repressed pride:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thar she blows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shipyard!&rdquo; This with depressed pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rilly! So it is! How wonderful!&rdquo; This with forced
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could have seen it when it was only marsh and
weeds and mud-holes and sluices you&rsquo;d appreciate what we&rsquo;ve
reclaimed and the work that has been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor pitched down a badly bruised road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the ship that&rsquo;s nearly done&ndash;&ndash;your mother&rsquo;s ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the shed, in among all that scaffolding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s a ship in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, and she&rsquo;s just bursting to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the yard, past a guardian who looked as if
a bottle of beer would buy him, and a breath strong enough
to blow off the froth would blow him over.</p>
<p>Within a great cage of falsework Marie Louise could see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
ship that Davidge had dedicated to his mother. But he did
not believe Marie Louise ready to understand it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin at the beginning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See those railroad
tracks over there? Well, that&rsquo;s where the timber comes
from the forests and the steel from the mills. Now we&rsquo;ll see
what happens to &rsquo;em in the shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her into the shed and showed her the traveling-cranes
that could pick up a locomotive between their long fingers
and carry it across the long room like a captured beetle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up-stairs is the mold-loft. It&rsquo;s our dressmaking-shop.
We lay down the design on the floor, and mark out every
piece of the ship in exact size, and then make templates of
wood to match&ndash;&ndash;those are the patterns. It&rsquo;s something like
making a gown, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Marie Louise. &ldquo;Then you fit the dress together
out in the yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve mastered the whole
thing already. It&rsquo;s a long climb up there. Will you try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, perhaps. I want to see these delightful what-you-may-call-&rsquo;ems
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched the men at work, each group about its own
machine, like priests at their various altars. Davidge explained
to her the cruncher that manicured thick plates of
steel sheets as if they were finger-nails, or beveled their edges;
the puncher that needled rivet-holes through them as if they
were silk, the ingenious Lysholm tables with rollers for tops.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was like a child in a wholesale toy-shop,
understanding nothing, ecstatic over everything, forbidden
to touch anything. In her ignorance of technical matters,
the simplest device was miraculous. The whole place was a
vast laboratory of mysteries and magic.</p>
<p>There was a something hallowed and awesome about it all.
It had a cathedral grandeur, even though it was a temple
builded with hands for the sake of the things builded with
hands. The robes of the votaries were grimy and greasy, and
the prayer they poured out was sweat. They chewed tobacco
and spat regardless. They eyed her as curiously as she them.
They swaggered each his own way, one by extra obliviousness,
another with a flourish of gesture. They seemed to want
to speak, and so did she, but embarrassment caused a common
silence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>On the ground they had cleared and under the roof they had
established they had fashioned vessels that should carry not
myrrh and nard to make a sweet smell or to end in a delicate
smoke, but wheat, milk and coal, clothes and shoes and shells,
for the feeding and warming of people in need, and for the destruction
of the god of destruction.</p>
<p>Marie Louise&rsquo;s response to the mood of the place was conversion,
a passion to take vows of eternal industry, to put
on the holy vestments of toil and wield the&ndash;&ndash;she did not even
know the names of the tools. She only knew that they were
sacred implements.</p>
<p>She was in an almost trancelike state when Davidge led
her from this world with its own sky of glass to the outer
world with the same old space-colored sky. He conducted
her among heaps of material waiting to be assembled, the
raw stuffs of creation.</p>
<p>As they drew near the almost finished ship the noise of the
riveting which had been but a vague palpitation of the air
became a well-nigh intolerable staccato.</p>
<p>Men were at work everywhere, Lilliputian against the bulk
of the hull they were contriving. Davidge escorted Marie
Louise with caution across tremulous planks, through dark
caverns into the hold of the ship.</p>
<p>In these grottoes of steel the clamor of the riveters grew
maddening in her ears. They were everywhere, holding their
machine-guns against reverberant metal and hammering steel
against steel with a superhuman velocity; for man had made
himself more than man by his own inventions, had multiplied
himself by his own machineries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the great Sutton,&rdquo; Davidge remarked, presently.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s our prima donna. He&rsquo;s the champion riveter of this
part of the country. Like to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise nodded yes before she noted that the man
was stripped to the waist. Runnels of sweat ran down his
flesh and shot from the muscles leaping beneath his swart hide.</p>
<p>Davidge went up to him and, after howling in vain, tapped
his brawn. Sutton looked up, shut off his noise, and turned
to Davidge with the impatience of a great tenor interrupted
in a cadenza by a mere manager.</p>
<p>Davidge yelled, with unnecessary voltage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sutton, I want to present you to Miss Webling.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>Sutton realized his nakedness like another Adam, and his
confusion confused Marie Louise. She nodded. He nodded.
Perhaps he made his muscles a little tauter.</p>
<p>Davidge had planned to ask Sutton to let Marie Louise
try to drive a rivet, just to show her how hopeless her ambition
was, but he dared not loiter. Marie Louise, feeling silly in
the silence, asked, stupidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a riveter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Sutton confessed, &ldquo;this is a riveter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Marie Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we&rsquo;ll move on,&rdquo; said Davidge. As conversation,
it was as unimportant as possible, but it had a negative
historical value, since it left Marie Louise unconvinced of her
inability to be a rivetress.</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and moved on. Davidge followed.
Sutton took up his work again, as a man does after a woman
has passed by, pretending to be indignant, trying by an added
ferocity to conceal his delight.</p>
<p>At a distance Davidge paused to say: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great card,
Sutton. He gets a lot of money, but he earns it before he
spends it, and he&rsquo;s my ideal of a workman. His work comes
first. He hogs all the pay the traffic will bear, but he goes
on working and he takes a pride in being better than anybody
else in his line. So many of these infernal laborers have only
one ideal&ndash;&ndash;to do the least possible work and earn enough to
loaf most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise thought of some of Jake Nuddle&rsquo;s principles
and wondered if she had done right in recommending him for
a place on Davidge&rsquo;s pay-roll. She was afraid he would be a
slacker, never dreaming that he would be industrious in all
forms of destruction. Jake never demanded short hours for
his conspiracies.</p>
<p>At the top of the unfinished deck Marie Louise forgot
Jake and gave her mind up to admiring Davidge as the father
of all this factory. He led her down, out and along the
bottom-land, through bogs, among heaps of rusty iron,
to a concrete building-slip. He seemed to be very important
about something, but she could not imagine what it was.
She saw nothing but a long girder made up of sections. It
lay along a flat sheet of perforated steel&ndash;&ndash;the homeliest contraption
imaginable.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is all this,&rdquo; she asked,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the beginning of a
bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no. It&rsquo;s the beginning of part of the bridge we&rsquo;re
building across the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that I quite follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the keel of a ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was the <i>Clara</i> like this once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. <i>Clara&rsquo;s</i> an old-fashioned creature like mother. This
is a newfangled thing like&ndash;&ndash;like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like me! This isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to be the <i>Mamise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not hide her disappointment in her namesake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess she&rsquo;s not very beautiful to start with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither were you at first, I suppose. I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your
pardon. I mean&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to tell her about the new principles of fabricated
ships, the standardizing of the parts, and their manufacture
at distances by various steel plants, the absence of curved
lines, the advantage of all the sacrifice of the old art for the
new speed.</p>
<p>In spite of what she had read she could not make his
information her own. And yet it was thrilling to look at.
She broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got to learn how to build ships. It&rsquo;s the one
thing on earth that will make me happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have to get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything I could do could make you happy&ndash;&ndash;cutting off
my right arm, or&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no end nice of you. But I am in earnest. I&rsquo;m
wretchedly unhappy, doing nothing. We women, I fancy,
are most of us just where boys are when they have outgrown
boyhood and haven&rsquo;t reached manhood&ndash;&ndash;when they are
crazy to be at something, and can&rsquo;t even decide where to
begin. Women have got to come out in the world and get to
work. Here&rsquo;s my job, and I want it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the delicate hands she fluttered before him,
and he smiled. She protested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always loved physical exercise. In England I did the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
roughest sort of farmwork. I&rsquo;m stronger than I look.
I think I&rsquo;d rather play one of those rat-tat-tat instruments
than&ndash;&ndash;than a harp in New Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not quite
strong enough. It takes a lot of power to hold the gun
against the hull. The compressed air kicks and shoves so
hard that even men tire quickly. Sutton himself has all he
can do to keep alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a hammer, then, and let me&ndash;&ndash;smite something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d rather begin in the office? You
could learn the business there first. Besides, I don&rsquo;t like the
thought of your roughing up those beautiful hands of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If men would only quit trying to keep women&rsquo;s hands soft
and clean, the world would be the better for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come down and learn the business first&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d be
nearer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sidestepped this sentimental jab and countered with a
practical left hook:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d teach me ship-building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather teach you home-building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean a home on the bounding main, I&rsquo;ll get right
to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stubborn about beginning with office tasks, and
he took her to the mold-loft. She was fascinated but appalled
by her own ignorance of what had come to be the most important
of all knowledge.</p>
<p>She sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been such a smatterer. I never
have really known anything about anything. Most women
are so astonishingly ignorant and indifferent about the
essentials of men&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She secretly resolved that she would study some of the
basic principles of male existence&ndash;&ndash;bookkeeping, drafting,
letter-writing, filing, trading. It amused her as a kind of new
mischief to take a course of business instruction on the sly
and report for duty not as an ignoramus, but as a past-mistress
in office practice. It was at least a refreshing novelty in
duplicity.</p>
<p>She giggled a little at the quaintness of her conspiracy.
The old song, &ldquo;Trust Her Not&ndash;&ndash;She Is Fooling Thee,&rdquo; occurred
to her in a fantastic parody: &ldquo;Trust her not&ndash;&ndash;she is
fooling thee; she is clandestine at the business college; she is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
leading a double-entry life. She writes you in longhand,
but she is studying shorthand. She is getting to be very fast&ndash;&ndash;on
the typewriter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge asked her why she snickered, but she would not
divulge her plot. She was impatient to spring it. She
wondered if in a week she could learn all she had to learn&ndash;&ndash;if
she worked hard. It would be rather pleasant to sit at his
desk-leaf and take dictation from him&ndash;&ndash;confidential letters
that he would intrust to no one else, letters written in a
whisper and full of dark references. She hoped she could
learn stenographic velocity in a few days.</p>
<p>As she and Davidge walked back to the car she noted the
workmen&rsquo;s shanties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I come here, may I live in one of those cunning new
bungalettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not! There are some nice houses in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of nice houses. I want to rough it. In the next
war millions of women will live in tents the way the men
do. Those shanties would be considered palaces in Belgium
and northern France. In fact, any number of women are
over there now building huts for the poor souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge grew more and more wretched. He could not
understand such a twisted courtship. His sweetheart did not
want jewels and luxuries and a life of wealthy ease. Her only
interest in him seemed to be that he would let her live in a
shanty, wear overalls, and pound steel all day for union
wages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>An eloquent contrast with Marie Louise was furnished
by Jake Nuddle. He was of the ebb type. He was
degenerating into a shirker, a destroyer, a money-maniac, a
complainer of other men&rsquo;s successes. His labor was hardly
more than a foundation for blackmailing. He loved no
country, had not even a sense of following the crowd. He
called the Star-spangled Banner a dirty rag, and he wanted
to wipe his feet on it. He was useless, baneful, doomed.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was coming into a new Canaan. What she
wanted was work for the work&rsquo;s sake, to be building something
and thereby building herself, to be helping her country forward,
to be helping mankind, poor and rich. The sight of the
flag made her heart ache with a rapture of patriotism. She
had the urge to march with an army.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was on the up grade, Jake on the down.
They met at the gate of the shipyard.</p>
<p>Jake and Abbie had come over by train. Jake was surly
in his tone to Davidge. His first question was, &ldquo;Where do
we live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise answered, &ldquo;In one of those quaint little
cottages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake frowned before he looked. He was one of those
who hate before they see, feel nausea before they taste,
condemn the unknown, the unheard, the unoffending.</p>
<p>By the time Jake&rsquo;s eyes had found the row of shanties
his frown was a splendid thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quaint little hog-pens!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Is this company
the same as all the rest&ndash;&ndash;treatin&rsquo; its slaves like swine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge knew the type. For the sake of Marie Louise he
restrained his first impulses and spoke with amiable acidity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are better houses in town, some of them very
handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah&ndash;&ndash;but what rent?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Rather expensive. Rather distant, too, but you can
make it easily in an automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where would I git a nautomobile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can introduce you to the man who sold me mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would I get the price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whurr&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all over the place. I used to be a common unskilled
laborer like you. And now I own a good part of this business.
Thousands of men who began poorer than I did are richer
than I am. The road&rsquo;s just as open to you as to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake had plenty of answers for this. He had memorized
numbers of them from the tracts; but also he had plans that
would not be furthered by quarreling with Davidge the first
day. He could do Davidge most harm by obeying him and
outwardly catering to him. He solaced his pride with a
thought of what Davidge&rsquo;s business would look like when
he got through with it.</p>
<p>He laughed: &ldquo;All right, boss. I was just beefin&rsquo;, for the
fun of beefin&rsquo;. Them shanties suit me elegant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his fool wife had to go and bust in, &ldquo;Oh, Jake, if
you would do like Mr. Davidge done, and git rich and live
easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake gave her a pantomimic rebuke that reduced her to a
pulpy silence.</p>
<p>Marie Louise thought to restore Abbie&rsquo;s spirits a little by
saying that she herself was coming down to work and to live
in one of those very shanties. But Abbie gave her up as
hopeless. Why any one should want to leave a house like
what Mamise had, and money in the bank, and no call to
lift her hand for nothing except to ring a bell and get somebody
to fetch anything, and leave all that and live like a
squatter and actually work&ndash;&ndash;well, it did beat all how foolish
some folks could be in the world nowadays.</p>
<p>Marie Louise left Abbie and Jake to establish themselves.
She had to get back to Washington. Davidge had planned
to go with her, but a long-distance telephone-call, and a visit
from a group of prospective strikers, and a warning that a
consignment of long-expected machinery had not yet arrived,
took him out of the car. He was tempted to go with Marie
Louise, anyway, but she begged him not to neglect his business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
for her unimportant self, and bade him good-by in an old
Wakefield phrase, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t see you again, hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She returned to Washington alone, but not lonely. Her
thoughts smoked through her brain like a dust-cloud of
shining particles, each radiant atom a great idea. The road
home was through the sky; the villages and groves were vague
pink clouds; the long downward slopes were shafts of sunlight,
the ridges rainbows.</p>
<p>It would take her hardly any time to conquer the mysteries
of stenography. Surely they must be easy, considering some
of the people that practised the art. She would study ship-building,
and drafting, too. Her water-color landscapes had
been highly praised by certain young men and old ladies in
England. She would learn how to keep her own bank-account
and revamp her arithmetic. She would take up light bookkeeping;
and she would build up her strength in a gymnasium
so that she could swing a sledge as well as the next one.
She would offer her home in Washington for rent. With the
mobs pouring in, it would not be untenanted long.</p>
<p>Her last expectation was realized first. The morning after
she reached home she visited Mr. Hailstorks and told him she
would sublet her mansion. Now that she wanted to collect
rent from it instead of paying rent for it her description of its
advantages was inevitably altered. With perfect sincerity
she described its very faults as attractions.</p>
<p>Thereafter her life was made miserable by the calls of
people who wanted to look the place over. She had incessant
offers, but she would not surrender her nest till she was ready
to go back to the shipyard, and that was always to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;the
movable to-morrow which like the horizon is always just
beyond.</p>
<p>She sent herself to school and was dazed by her ignorance.
In arithmetic she had forgotten what she had gained at the
age of ten, and it was not easy to recapture it.</p>
<p>On the typewriter she had to learn the alphabet all over
again in a new order, and this was fiendishly hard. She
studied the touch-system with the keyboard covered, and her
blunders were disheartening. Her deft fingers seemed hardly
to be her own. They would not obey her will at all.</p>
<p>Shorthand was baffling. It took her five times as long to
write in shorthand as in longhand such thrilling literature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
as: &ldquo;Dear customer,&ndash;&ndash;Letter received and contents noted.
In reply to same would say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first she was a trifle snobbish and stand-offish with some
of the pert young fellow-pupils, but before long her opinion
of them increased to a respect verging on awe.</p>
<p>They could take dictation, chew gum, and fix their back
hair with the free hand all at once. Their fingers pattered the
keyboard like rain, and their letters were exquisitely neat.
They had studied for a long time, and had acquired proficiency.
And it is no easy thing to acquire proficiency in any
task, from cobbling shoes to polishing sonnets or moving
armies.</p>
<p>Marie Louise was humiliated to find that she really did not
know how to spell some of the simplest words. When she
wrote with running pen she never stopped to spell. She just
sketched the words and let them go. She wrote, &ldquo;I beleive
I recieved,&rdquo; so that nobody could tell <i>e</i> from <i>i</i>; and she put
the dot where it might apply to either. Her punctuation
was all dashes.</p>
<p>The typewriter would not permit anything vague. A word
stood out in its stark reality, howling &ldquo;Illiterate!&rdquo; at her.
Her punctuation simply would not do.</p>
<p>Pert young misses who were honored by a wink from an
ice-cream-soda-counter keeper or by an invitation to a street-car
conductors&rsquo; dance turned out work of a Grecian perfection,
while Marie Louise bit her lips and blushed with shame under
the criticisms of her teacher. She was back in school again,
the dunce of the class, and abject discouragements alternated
with spurts of zeal.</p>
<p>In the mean while the United States was also learning the
rudiments of war and the enormous office-practice it required.
Before the war was over the army of 118,000 men and 5,000
officers in February, 1917, would be an army of over 3,000,000,
and of these over 2,000,000 would have been carried to
Europe, half of them in British ships; 50,000 of these would
be killed to Russia&rsquo;s 1,700,000 dead, Germany&rsquo;s 1,600,000,
France&rsquo;s 1,385,000, England&rsquo;s 706,200, Italy&rsquo;s 406,000, and
Belgium&rsquo;s 102,000. The wounded Americans would be three
times the total present army. Everybody was ignorant,
blunderful. Externally and internally the United States was
as busy as a trampled ant-hill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>Everything in those days was done in drives. The armies
made drives; the financiers made drives; the charities made
drives. The world-heart was never so driven. And this was
all on top of the ordinary human suffering, which did not
abate one jot for all its overload. Teeth ached just as fiercely;
jealousy was just as sickly green; empires crackled; people
starved in herds; cities were pounded to gravel; army after
army was taken prisoner or slaughtered; yet each agitated
atom in the chaos was still the center of the tormented universe.</p>
<p>Marie Louise suffered for mankind and for herself. She
was lonely, love-famished, inept, dissatisfied, and abysmally
ashamed of her general ineffectiveness. Then one of Washington&rsquo;s
infamous hot weeks supervened. In the daytime the
heat stung like a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails. The nights were suffocation.
She &ldquo;slept,&rdquo; gasping as a fish flounders on dry land.
After the long strain of fighting for peace, toiling for rest,
the mornings would find Marie Louise as wrecked as if she had
come in from a prolonged spree. Then followed a day of
drudgery at the loathly necessities of her stupid work.</p>
<p>Detail and delay are the tests of ambition. Ambition sees
the mountain-peak blessed with sunlight and cries, &ldquo;That is
my goal!&rdquo; But the feet must cross every ditch, wade every
swamp, scramble across every ledge. The peak is the harder
to see the nearer it comes; the last cliffs hide it altogether,
and when it is reached it is only a rough crag surrounded by
higher crags. The glory that lights it is glory in distant eyes
alone.</p>
<p>So for poor Mamise. She had run away from a squalid
home to the gorgeous freedom of stage-life, only to find that
the stage also is squalid and slavish, and that the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
of gorgeous freedom had jumped back to home life.
She left the cheap theaters for the expensive luxury of Sir
Joseph&rsquo;s mansion. But that had its squalors and slaveries,
too. She had fled from troubled England to joyous America,
only to find in America a thousand distresses.</p>
<p>Then her eyes had been caught with the glitter of true
freedom. She would be a builder of ships&ndash;&ndash;cast off the restraint
of womanhood and be a magnificent builder of ships!
And now she was finding that this dream was also a nightmare.</p>
<p>Everywhere she looked was dismay, futility, failure. The
hot wave found her an easy victim. A frightened servant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
who did not know the difference between sunstroke and heat
prostration nearly killed her before a doctor came.</p>
<p>The doctor sent Marie Louise to bed, and in bed she stayed.
It was her trained nurse who wrote a letter to Mr. Davidge
regretting that she could not come to the launching of the
<i>Clara</i>. Abbie was not present, either. She came up to be
with Marie Louise. This was not the least of Marie Louise&rsquo;s
woes.</p>
<p>She was quite childish about missing the great event.
She wept because another hand swung the netted champagne-bottle
against the bow as it lurched down the toboggan-slide.</p>
<p>Davidge wrote her about the launching, but it was a business
man&rsquo;s letter, with the poetry all smothered. He told her that
there had been an accident or two, and nearly a disaster&ndash;&ndash;an
unexploded infernal-machine had been found. A scheme to
wreck the launching-ways had been detected on the final
inspection.</p>
<p>Marie Louise read the letter aloud to Abbie, and, even
though she knew the ship was safe, trembled as if it were still
in jeopardy. Her shaken faith in humanity was still capable
of feeling bewilderment at the extremes of German savagery.
She cried out to her sister:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How on earth can anybody be fiendish enough to have
tried to destroy that ship even before it was launched? How
could a German spy have got into the yard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t have to have been a German,&rdquo; said Abbie,
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else would have wanted to play such a dastardly
trick? No American would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it depends on what you call Amurrican,&rdquo; said
Abbie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some them Independent workmen so independent
they ain&rsquo;t got any country any more &rsquo;n what
Cain had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t suppose that Mr. Davidge has enemies among
his own people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course he has! Slews of &rsquo;em. Some them workmen
can&rsquo;t forgive the man that gives &rsquo;em a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he pays big wages. Think of what Jake gets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, him! If he got all they was, he&rsquo;d holler he was bein&rsquo;
cheated. Hollerin&rsquo; and hatin&rsquo; always come easy to Jake. If
they wasn&rsquo;t easy, he wouldn&rsquo;t do &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>Marie Louise gasped: &ldquo;Abbie! In Heaven&rsquo;s name, you
don&rsquo;t imply&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Abbie. &ldquo;I never implied in my
life, and don&rsquo;t you go sayin&rsquo; I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie was at bay now. She had to defend her man from
outside suspicion. Suspicion of her husband is a wife&rsquo;s
prerogative</p>
<p>Marie Louise was too much absorbed in the general vision
of man&rsquo;s potential villainy to follow up the individual clue.
She was frightened away from considering Jake as a candidate
for such infamy. Her wildest imaginings never put him in
association with Nicky Easton.</p>
<p>There were so many excursions and alarms in the world
of 1917 that the riddle of who tried to sink the ship on dry
land joined a myriad others in the riddle limbo.</p>
<p>When Marie Louise was well enough to go back to her
business school she found riddles enough in trying to decide
where this letter or that had got to on the crazy keyboard,
or what squirmy shorthand symbol it was that represented
this syllable or that.</p>
<p>She had lost the little speed she had had, and it was double
drudgery regaining the forgotten lore. But she stood the gaff
and found herself on the dizzy height of graduation from a
lowly business school. She had traveled a long way from the
snobbery of her recent years.</p>
<p>Davidge recognized her face and her voice when she presented
herself before him. But her soul was an utter stranger.
She did not invite him to call on her or warn him that she
was coming to call on him.</p>
<p>She appeared in his anteroom and bribed one of the clerks
to go to him with a message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young lady&rsquo;s outside&ndash;&ndash;wants a position&ndash;&ndash;as a stenogerpher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge growled without looking up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bother me? Send her to the chief clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants to see you specially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said Miss Webling sent her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord!&ndash;&ndash;show her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Louise entered. Davidge looked up, leaped up.</p>
<p>She did not come in with the drawing-room, train-dragging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
manner of Miss Webling. She did not wear the insolent
beauty of Mamise of the Musical Mokes. She was a white-waisted,
plain-skirted office-woman, a businessette. She had
a neat little hat and gave him a secretarial bow.</p>
<p>He rushed to her hand, and they had a good laugh like two
children playing pretend. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the camouflage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word was not very new even then, or he would not
have used it.</p>
<p>She explained, with royal simplicity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought out her diploma and a certificate giving her a
civil-service status. She was quite conceited about it.</p>
<p>She insisted on displaying her accomplishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me some dictation,&rdquo; she dictated.</p>
<p>He nodded, pummeled his head for an idea while she took
from her hand-bag, not a vanity-case, but a stenographer&rsquo;s
notebook and a sheaf of pencils.</p>
<p>He noted that she sat down stenographically&ndash;&ndash;very concisely.
She perched her notebook on the desk of one crossed
knee and perked her eyes up as alertly as a sparrow.</p>
<p>All this professionalism sat so quaintly on the two Marie
Louises he had known that he roared with laughter as at a
child dressed up.</p>
<p>She smiled patiently at his uproar till it subsided. Then he
sobered and began to dictate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready? &lsquo;Miss Mamise&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;cross that out&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Miss Marie
Louise Webling&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;you know the address; I don&rsquo;t. &lsquo;Dear&ndash;&ndash;My
dear&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;no, just &lsquo;Dear Miss Webling. Reference is had
to your order of recent date that this house engage you as
amanuensis.&rsquo; Dictionary in the bookcase outside&ndash;&ndash;comma&ndash;&ndash;no,
period. &lsquo;In reply I would&ndash;&ndash;I wish to&ndash;&ndash;I beg to&ndash;&ndash;we beg
to say that we should&ndash;&ndash;I should just as soon engage Mona
Lisa for a stenographer as you.&rsquo; Period and paragraph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have,&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;comma,&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;however,&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;comma,&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;another position
to offer you,&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;comma,&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;that is, as wife to the senior
member of this firm.&rsquo; Period. &lsquo;The best wages we can&ndash;&ndash;we
can offer you are&ndash;&ndash;is the use of one large,&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;comma,&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;slightly
damaged heart and a million thanks a minute.&rsquo;
Period. &lsquo;Trusting that we may be favored with a prompt
and favorable reply, we am&ndash;&ndash;I are&ndash;&ndash;am&ndash;&ndash;yours very sincerely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
truly yours,&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;no, just say &lsquo;yours,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll sign it.
By the way, do you know what the answer will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I know the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long glum pause till she said, &ldquo;Am I fired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More pause. She intervened in his silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I do next, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, of habit, &ldquo;Why, sail on, and on, and on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached for his basket of unanswered mail. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you a sample of my style, now you give me a
sample of yours, and then I&rsquo;ll see if I can afford to keep you
as a stenographer instead of a wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, went to a typewriter in a corner of his office,
and seated herself at the musicless instrument. Her heart
pit-a-patted as fast as her fingers, but she drew up the letter
in a handsome style while he sat and stared at her and mused
upon the strange radiance she brought into the office in a
kind of aureole.</p>
<p>He grew abruptly serious when Miss Gabus, his regular
stenographer, entered and stared at the interloper with amazement,
comma, suspicion, comma, and hostility, period. She
murmured a very rasping &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; and stepped
out, as Marie Louise rose from the writing-machine and
brought him an extraordinarily accurate version of his letter.</p>
<p>And now he had two women on his hands and one on his
heart. He dared not oust Miss Gabus for the sake of Miss
Webling. He dared not show his devotion to Marie Louise,
though as a matter of fact it made him glow like a lighthouse.</p>
<p>He put Mamise to work in the chief clerk&rsquo;s office. It was
noted that he made many more trips to that office than ever
before. Instead of pressing the buzzer for a boy or a stenographer,
he usually came out himself on all sorts of errands.
His buzzer did not buzz, but the gossip did.</p>
<p>Mamise was vaguely aware of it, and it distressed her till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
she grew furious. She was so furious at Davidge for not
being deft enough to conceal his affection that she began
to resent it as an offense and not a compliment.</p>
<p>The impossible Mamise insisted on taking up her residence
in one of the shanties. When he took the liberty of urging
her to live at a hotel or at some of the more comfortable
homes she snubbed him bluntly. When he desperately urged
her to take lunch or dinner with him she drew herself up and
mocked the virtuous scorn of a movie stenographer and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir! I may be only a poor typist, but no wicked capitalist
shall loor me to lunch with him. You&rsquo;d probably drug the
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will not go motoring with you. How dare you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I call, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More as a punishment than a hospitality, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir&ndash;&ndash;the fourteenth house on the left side of the road
is me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The days were still long and the dark tardy when he marched
up the street. It was a gantlet of eyes and whispers. He felt
inane to an imbecility. The whole village was eying the
boss on his way to spark a stenog. His little love-affair
was as clandestine as Lady Godiva&rsquo;s famous bareback ride.</p>
<p>He cut his call short after an age-long half-hour of enduring
the ridicule twinkling in Mamise&rsquo;s eyes. He stayed just late
enough for it to get dark enough to conceal his return through
that street. He was furious at the situation and at Mamise
for teasing him so. But she became all the dearer for her
elusiveness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>After the novelty of the joke wore off Mamise grew as
uncomfortable as he. She was beginning to love him
more and her job less. But she was determined not to throw
away her independence. Pride was her duenna, and a ruthless
one. She tried to feed her pride on her ambition and on an
occasional visit to the ship that was to wear her name.</p>
<p>She met Sutton, the prima donna riveter. He was always
clattering away like a hungry woodpecker, but he always had
time to stop and discuss his art with her.</p>
<p>Once or twice he let her try the riveter&ndash;&ndash;the &ldquo;gun,&rdquo; he called
it; but her thumb was not strong enough to hold the trigger
against that hundred-and-fifty-pound pressure per square inch.</p>
<p>One day Marie Louise came on Jake Nuddle and Sutton in
a wrangle. She caught enough of the parley to know that
Jake was sneering at Sutton&rsquo;s waste of energy and enthusiasm,
his long hours and low pay. Sutton earned a very substantial
income, but all pay was low pay to Jake, who was spreading
the gospel of sabotage through the shipyard.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the good ship <i>Clara</i>, weaned from the dock,
floated in the basin and received her equipment. And at last
the day came when she was ready for her trial trip.</p>
<p>That morning the smoke rolled from her funnels in a twisted
skein. What had once been ore in many a mine, and trees
in many a forest, had become an individual, as what has been
vegetables and fruits and the flesh of animals becomes at last
a child with a soul, a name, a fate.</p>
<p>It was impossible to think now that the <i>Clara</i> was merely
an iron box with an engine to push it about. <i>Clara</i> was somebody,
a personality, a lovable, whimsical, powerful creature.
She was &ldquo;she&rdquo; to everybody. And at last one morning she
kicked up her heels and took a long white bone in her teeth
and went her ways.</p>
<p>The next day <i>Clara</i> came back. There was something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
about her manner of sweeping into the bay, about the proud
look of her as she came to a halt, that convinced all the
watchers in the shipyard of her success.</p>
<p>When they learned that she had exceeded all her contract
stipulations there was a tumult of rejoicing; for her success
was the success of every man and lad in the company&rsquo;s
employ&ndash;&ndash;at least so thought all who had any instinct of team-play
and collective pride. A few soreheads were glum, or
sneered at the enthusiasm of the others. It was strange that
Jake Nuddle was associated with all of these groups.</p>
<p><i>Clara</i> was not permitted to linger and rest on her laurels.
She had work to do. Every ship in the world was working
overtime except the German Kiel Canal boats. <i>Clara</i> was
gone from the view the next morning. Mamise missed her as
she looked from the office window. She mentioned this to
Davidge, for fear he might not know. Somebody might have
stolen her. He explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going down to Norfolk to take on a cargo of food
for England&ndash;&ndash;wheat for the Allies. I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s going to
take breadstuffs to people. My mother used to be always
going about to hungry folks with a basket of food on her
arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise had Jake and Abbie in to dinner that night. She
was all agog about the success of <i>Clara</i>, and hoped that
<i>Mamise</i> would one day do as well.</p>
<p>Jake took a sudden interest in the matter. &ldquo;Did the boss
tell you where the <i>Clara</i> was goin&rsquo; to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;Norfolk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake considered his unmentionable cigar a few minutes,
then rose and mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; out to get some more cigars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie called after him, &ldquo;Hay, you got a whole half-box
left.&rdquo; But Jake did not seem to hear the recall.</p>
<p>He came back later cigarless and asked for the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you went out to git some,&rdquo; said Abbie, who felt
it necessary to let no occasion slip for reminding him of some
blunder he had made. Jake laughed very amiably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so I did, and I went into a cigar-store, at that.
But I hadda telephone a certain party, long-distance&ndash;&ndash;and I
forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie broke in, &ldquo;Who you got to long-distance to?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>Jake did not answer.</p>
<p>Two days later Davidge was so proud that he came out
into the main office and told all the clerks of the new distinction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They loaded the <i>Clara</i> in record time with wheat for
England. She sails to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his first chance to speak to Marie Louise he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You compared her to Little Red Riding Hood&ndash;&ndash;remember?
Well, she&rsquo;s starting out through the big woods with a lot of
victuals for old Granny England. If only the wolves don&rsquo;t
get her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt, and Mamise felt, as lonely and as anxious for her
as if she were indeed a little red-bonneted forest-farer on an
errand of mercy.</p>
<p>Ships have always been dear to humankind because of the
dangers they run and because of the pluck they show in
storms and fires, and the unending fights they make against
wind and wave. But of late they had had unheard-of enemies
to meet, the submarine and the infernal machine placed
inside the cargo.</p>
<p>Marie Louise spoke of this at the supper-table that night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think, with so little food in the world and so many
starving to death, people could sink ships full of wheat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the second day after the <i>Clara</i> set forth on the ocean
Marie Louise took dictation for an hour and wrote out her
letters as fast as she could. In the afternoon she took the
typewritten transcripts into Davidge&rsquo;s office to drop them
into his &ldquo;in&rdquo; basket.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. His hand went out to it, and she
heard him say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Davidge speaking.... Hello, Ed.... What?
You&rsquo;re too close to the &rsquo;phone.... That&rsquo;s better.... You&rsquo;re
too far away&ndash;&ndash;start all over.... I don&rsquo;t get that.... Yes&ndash;&ndash;a
life-boat picked up with what&ndash;&ndash;oh, six survivors. Yes&ndash;&ndash;from
what ship? I say, six survivors from what ship?... The
<i>Clara</i>? She&rsquo;s gone? <i>Clara</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reeled and wavered in his chair. &ldquo;What happened&ndash;&ndash;many
lost? And the boat&ndash;&ndash;cargo&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;everybody
but those six! They got her, then! The Germans got her&ndash;&ndash;on
her first voyage! God damn their guts! Good-by, Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to be calm, but the hand that held up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
receiver groped for the hook with a pitiful blind man&rsquo;s
gesture.</p>
<p>Mamise could not resist that blundering helplessness. She
ran forward and took his hand and set the receiver in place.</p>
<p>He was too numb to thank her, but he was grateful. His
mother was dead. The ship he had named for her was dead.
He needed mothering.</p>
<p>Mamise put her hands on his shoulders and gripped them
as if to hold them together under their burden. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard. I can&rsquo;t tell you how&ndash;&ndash; Oh, what can we do in
such a world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed foolishly and said, with a stumbling voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a German for this&ndash;&ndash;somehow!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Mamise shuddered when she heard the blood-cry wrung
out of Davidge&rsquo;s agony.</p>
<p>She knew that the ship was more than a ship to him.
Its death was as the death of many children. It might mean
the death of many children. She stood over him, weeping
for him like another Niobe among her slaughtered family.
The business man in his tragedy had to have some woman at
hand to do his weeping for him. He did not know how to
sob his own heart out.</p>
<p>She felt the vigor of a high anger grip his muscles. When
she heard him groan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a German for this!&rdquo; somehow
it horrified her, coming from him; yet it was becoming the
watchword of the whole nation.</p>
<p>America had stood by for three years feeding Europe&rsquo;s
hungry and selling munitions to the only ones that could come
and get them. America had been forced into the war by the
idiotic ingenuities of the Germans, who kept frustrating all
their own achievements, the cruel ones thwarting the clever
ones; the liars undermining the fighters; the wise, who
knew so much, not knowing the first thing&ndash;&ndash;that torture never
succeeded, that a reputation for broken faith is the most
expensive of all reputations, that a policy of terror and
trickery and megalomania can accomplish nothing but its
own eventual ruin.</p>
<p>America was aroused at last. The German rhinoceros in
its blind charges had wakened and enraged the mammoth.
A need for German blood was the frank and undeniable passion
of the American Republic. To kill enough Germans fast
enough to crush them and their power and their glory was the
acknowledged business of the United States until further
notice.</p>
<p>The strangest people were voicing this demand. Preachers
were thundering it across their pulpits, professors across their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
desks, women across their cradles, pacifists across their shattered
dreams, business men across their counters, &ldquo;Kill
Germans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a frightful crusade; yet who was to blame for it but
the Germans and their own self-advertised frightfulness? The
world was fighting for its life and health against a plague, a
new outrush from that new plague-spot whence so many
floods of barbarism had broken over civilization.</p>
<p>They came forth now in gray streams like the torrent of rats
that pursued the wicked Bishop Hatto to his tower. Only the
world was not Bishop Hatto, and it did not flee. It gathered to
one vast circular battle, killing and killing rats upon rats in a
frenzy of loathing that grew with the butchery.</p>
<p>Countless citizens of German origin fought and died with
the Americans, but nobody thought of them as Germans now,
and least of all did they so think of themselves. In the mind
of the Allied nations, German and vermin were linked in
rhyme and reason.</p>
<p>It may be unjust and unsympathetic, but the very best
people feel it a duty to destroy microbes, insects, and beasts
of prey without mercy. The Germans themselves had proclaimed
their own nature with pride. Peaceful Belgium&ndash;&ndash;invaded,
burned, butchered, ravished, dismantled, mulcted,
deported, enslaved&ndash;&ndash;was the first sample of German work.</p>
<p>Davidge had hated Germany&rsquo;s part in the war from the first,
for the world&rsquo;s sake, for the sake of the little nations trampled
and starved and the big nations thrown into desperation, and
for the insolence and omnipresence of the German menace&ndash;&ndash;for
the land filled with graves, the sea with ships, the air with
indiscriminate slaughter.</p>
<p>Now it had come straight home to himself. His own ship
was assassinated; the hill of wheat she carried had been
spilled into the sterile sea. Nearly all of her crew had
been murdered or drowned. He had a blood-feud of his
own with Germany.</p>
<p>He was startled to find Mamise recoiling from him. He
looked at her with a sudden demand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it shock you to have me hate &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No, indeed!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of them,
but of you. I never saw you before like this. You scared me
a little. I didn&rsquo;t know you could be so angry.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not half as angry as I&rsquo;d like to be. Don&rsquo;t you abominate
&rsquo;em, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&ndash;&ndash;I wish that Germany were one big ship and all
the Germans on board, and I had a torpedo big enough to
blast them all to&ndash;&ndash;where they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wish seemed to him to prove a sufficient lack of affection
for the Germans, and he added, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; with a little
nervous reaction into uncouth laughter.</p>
<p>But this was only another form of his anguish. At such
times the distraught soul seems to have need of all its
emotions and expressions, and to run among them like a
frantic child.</p>
<p>Davidge&rsquo;s next mood was a passionate regret for the crew,
the dead engineers and sailors shattered and blasted and
cast into the sea, the sufferings of the little squad that escaped
into a life-boat without water or provisions or shelter from
the sun and the lashing spray.</p>
<p>Then he pictured the misery of hunger that the ship&rsquo;s cargo
would have relieved. He had been reading much of late of the
Armenian&ndash;&ndash;what word or words could name that woe so
multitudinous that, like the number of the stars, the mind
refused to attempt its comprehension?</p>
<p>He saw one of those writhing columns winding through a
rocky wilderness&ndash;&ndash;old crones knocked aside to shrivel with
famine, babies withering like blistered flowers from the
flattened breasts of their mothers dying with hunger, fatigue,
blows, violation, and despair. He thought of Poland childless
and beyond pity; of the Serbian shambles. The talons of
hunger a millionfold clutched him, and he groaned aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;d only stolen my wheat and given it to somebody&ndash;&ndash;to
anybody! But to pour it into the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not linger in that slough and stay sane. His
struggling soul broke loose from the depths and hunted safety
in self-ridicule:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might better have left the wheat at home and never have
built the fool ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to laugh again, an imbecile ironic cachinnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blithering idiot I&rsquo;ve been! To go and work and work
and work, and drive my men and all the machinery for months
and months to make a ship and put in the engines and send
it down and load it, and all for some&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a gesture expressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
his unspeakable thought&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;of a German to blow it to hell
and gone, with a little clock-bomb in one second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his abysmal discouragement his ideals were all topsy-turvy.
He burlesqued his own religion as the most earnest
constantly do, for we all revolve around ourselves as well as
our suns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use,&rdquo; he maundered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of
trying to do anything while they&rsquo;re alive and at work right
here in our country? They&rsquo;re everywhere! They swarm
like cockroaches out of every hole as soon as the light gets
low! We&rsquo;ve got to blister &rsquo;em all to death with rough-on-rats
before we can build anything that will last. There&rsquo;s no
stopping them without wiping &rsquo;em off the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not argue with him. At such times people do not
want arguments or good counsel or correction. They want
somebody to stand by in mute fellowship to watch and listen
and suffer, too. So Mamise helped Davidge through that
ordeal. He turned from rage at the Germans to contempt
for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I quit out of this and went to work with the army.
It makes me sick to be here making ships for Germans to sink.
The thing to do is to kill the Germans first and build the ships
when the sea is safe for humanity. I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself
sitting in an office shooting with a telephone and giving out
plans and contracts and paying wages to a gang of mechanics.
It&rsquo;s me for a rifle and a bayonet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise had to oppose this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to get you soldiers across the sea or feed you
when you get there if all the ship-builders turn soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let somebody else do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who can do it as well as you can? The Germans said
that America could never put an army across or feed it if she
got it there. If you go on strike you&rsquo;ll prove the truth of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she began to chant his own song to him. A man likes
to hear his nobler words recalled. Here is one of the best resources
a woman has. Mamise was speaking for him as well
as for herself when she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember how you thrilled me with your talk of all
the ships you would build. You said it was the greatest poem
ever written, the idea of making ships faster than the Germans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
could sink them. It was that that made me want to be a
ship-builder. It was the first big ambition I ever had. And
now you tell me it&rsquo;s useless and foolish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the point without further pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My job&rsquo;s here. It would be
selfish and showy to knock off this work and grab a gun. I&rsquo;ll
stick. It&rsquo;s hard, though, to settle down here when everybody
else is bound for France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was one of those unusual wise persons who do not
continue to argue a case that has already been won. She added
only the warm personal note to help out the cold generality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my ship to finish, you know. You couldn&rsquo;t leave
poor <i>Mamise</i> out there on the stocks unfinished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The personal note was so warm that he reached out for her.
He needed her in his arms. He caught her roughly to him and
knew for the first time the feel of her body against his, the
sweet compliance of her form to his embrace.</p>
<p>But there was an anachronism to her in the contact. She
was in one of those moods of exaltation, of impersonal nationalism,
that women were rising to more and more as a new
religion. She was feeling terribly American, and, though
she had no anger for him and saw no insult in his violence,
she seemed to be above and beyond mere hugging and kissing.
She was in a Joan of Arc humor, so she put his hands away,
yet squeezed them with fervor, for she knew that she had
saved him from himself and to himself. She had brought him
back to his east again, and the morning is always wonderful.</p>
<p>She had renewed his courage, however, so greatly that he
did not despair of her. He merely postponed her, as people
were postponing everything beautiful and lovable &ldquo;for the
duration of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached for the buzzer. Already Mamise heard its
rattlesnake clatter. But his hand paused and went to hers
as he stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone through this together, and you&rsquo;ve helped me&ndash;&ndash;I
can&rsquo;t tell you how much, honey. Only, I hope we can go
through a lot more trouble together. There&rsquo;s plenty of it
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt proud and meek and dismally happy. She squeezed
his big hand again in both of hers and sighed, with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>Then he pressed the buzzer, and Miss Gabus was inside the
door with suspicious promptitude. Davidge said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Avery, please&ndash;&ndash;and the others&ndash;&ndash;all the others right
away. Ask them to come here; and you might come back,
Miss Gabus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Avery, the chief clerk, and other clerks and stenographers,
gathered, wondering what was about to happen.
Some of them came grinning, for when they had asked Miss
Gabus what was up she had guessed: &ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
announce his engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The office force came in like an ill-drilled comic-opera
chorus. Davidge waited till the last-comer was waiting.
Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks, I&rsquo;ve just had bad news. The <i>Clara</i>&ndash;&ndash;they got her!
The Germans got her. She was blown up by a bomb. She
was two days out and going like a greyhound when she sank
with all on board except six of the crew who got away in a life-boat
and were picked up by a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a shock of silence, then a hubbub of gasps, oaths,
of incredulous protests.</p>
<p>Miss Gabus was the first to address Davidge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Gawd! Mr. Davidge, what you goin&rsquo; to do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They thought him a man of iron when he said, quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll build some more ships. And if they sink those
we&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;build some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a man of iron, but iron can bend and break and melt,
and so can steel. Yet there is a renewal of strength, and,
thanks to Mamise, Davidge was recalled to himself, though
he was too shrewd or too tactful to give her the credit for
redeeming him.</p>
<p>His resolute words gave the office people back to their own
characters or their own reactions and their first phrases. Each
had something to say. One, &ldquo;She was such a pretty boat!&rdquo;
another, &ldquo;Was she insured, d&rsquo;you suppose?&rdquo; a third, a fourth,
and the rest: &ldquo;The poor engineer&ndash;&ndash;and the sailors!&rdquo; &ldquo;All
that work for nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; &ldquo;The money she cost!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Belgians
could &rsquo;a&rsquo; used that wheat!&rdquo; &ldquo;Those Germans! Is there
anything they won&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief clerk shepherded them back to their tasks.
Davidge took up the telephone to ask for more steel. Mamise
renewed the cheerful <i>rap-rap-rap</i> of her typewriter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>The shock that struck the office had yet to rush through the
yard. There was no lack of messengers to go among the
men with the bad word that the first of the Davidge ships
had been destroyed. It was a personal loss to nearly everybody,
as it had been to Davidge, for nearly everybody had
put some of his soul and some of his sweat into that slow and
painful structure so instantly annulled. The mockery of the
wasted toil embittered every one. The wrath of the workers
was both loud and ferocious.</p>
<p>Jake Nuddle was one of the few who did not revile the German
plague. He was not in the least excited over the dead
sailors. They did not belong to his union. Besides, Jake
did not love work or the things it made. He claimed to love
the workers and the money they made.</p>
<p>He was tactless enough to say to a furious orator:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what&rsquo;s it to you? The more ships the Germans sink
the more you got to build and the more they&rsquo;ll have to pay
you. If Davidge goes broke, so much the better. The sooner
we bust these capitalists the sooner the workin&rsquo;-man gets his
rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orator retorted: &ldquo;This is war-times. We got to make
ships to win the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake laughed. &ldquo;Whose war is it? The capitalists&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re
fightin&rsquo; for Morgan and Rockefeller to save their investments
and to help &rsquo;em to grind you into the dirt. England and
France and America are all land-grabbers. They&rsquo;re no
better &rsquo;n Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The workers wanted a scapegoat, and Jake unwittingly
volunteered. They welcomed him with a bloodthirsty roar.
They called him vigorous shipyard names and struck at him.
He backed off. They followed. He made a crucial mistake;
he whirled and ran. They ran after him. Some of them
threw hammers and bolts. Some of these struck him as he
fled. Workmen ahead of him were roused by the noise and
headed him off.</p>
<p>He darted through an opening in the side of the <i>Mamise</i>.
The crowd followed him, chased him out on an upper deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw him overboard! Kill him!&rdquo; they shouted.</p>
<p>He took refuge behind Sutton the riveter, whose gun had
made such noise that he had heard none of the clamor. Seeing
Jake&rsquo;s white face and the mark of a thrown monkey-wrench
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
on his brow, Sutton shut off the compressed air and confronted
the pursuers. He was naked to the waist, and he had
no weapon, but he held them at bay while he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big idea? What you playin&rsquo;? Puss in a
corner? How many of yous guys does it take to lick this one
gink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A burly patriot, who forgot that his name and his accent
were Teutonic, roared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Der sneagin&rsquo; Sohn off a peach ain&rsquo;t sorry <i>die Clara</i> is by
dose tam Chermans <i>gesunken</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Sutton howled. &ldquo;The <i>Clara</i> sunk? Whatya mean&ndash;&ndash;sunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bohlmann told him. Sutton wavered. He had driven
thousands of rivets into the frame of the ship, and a little
explosive had opened all the seams and ended her days!
When at last he understood the <i>Clara&rsquo;s</i> fate and Nuddle&rsquo;s
comments he turned to Jake with baleful calm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you thought it was good business, did you? And
these fellers was thinkin&rsquo; about lynchin&rsquo; you, was they? Well,
they&rsquo;re all wrong&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re all wrong: we&rsquo;d ought to save
lynchin&rsquo; for real guys. What you need is somethin&rsquo; like&ndash;&ndash;this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His terrific fist lashed out and caught Jake in the right eye.
Jake in a daze of indignation and amazement went over backward;
his head struck the steel deck, and his soul went out.
When it came back he lay still for a while, pretending to be
unconscious until the gang had dispersed, satisfied, and Sutton
was making ready to begin riveting again. Then he picked
himself up and edged round Sutton, growling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you for this, you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sutton did not wait to learn what Jake was going to call
him. His big foot described an upward arc, and Jake a
parabola, ending in a drop that almost took him through an
open hatch into the depth of the hold. He saved himself,
peering over the edge, too weak for words&ndash;&ndash;hunched back,
crawled around the steel abyss, and betook himself to a safe
hiding-place under the tank-top till the siren should blow
and disperse his enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>The office force left pretty promptly on the hour. When
Mamise noted that desks were being cleared for inaction
she began mechanically to conform. Then she paused.</p>
<p>On other afternoons she had gone home with the crowd of
employees, too weary with office routine to be discontent.
But now she thought of Davidge left alone in his office to
brood over his lost ship, the brutal mockery of such loving
toil. It seemed heartless to her as his friend to desert him
in the depths. But as one of his stenographers, it would look
shameless to hang round with the boss. She shifted from foot
to foot and from resolve to resolve.</p>
<p>Their relations were undergoing as many strains and stresses
as a ship&rsquo;s frame in the various waves and weathers that confront
it. She had picked up some knowledge of the amazing
twists a ship encounters at rest and in motion&ndash;&ndash;stresses in
still water, with cargo and without, hogging and sagging
stresses, seesaw strains, tensile, compressive, transverse, racking,
pounding; bumps, blows, collisions, oscillations, running
aground&ndash;&ndash;stresses that crumpled steel or scissored the rivets
in two.</p>
<p>It was hard to foresee the critical stress that should mean
life or death to the ship and its people. Some went humbly
forth and came home with rich cargo; some steamed out in
pride and never came back; some limped in from the sea
racked and ruined; some ran stupidly ashore in fogs; some
fought indomitably through incredible tempests. Some died
dramatic deaths on cliffs where tidal waves hammered them
to shreds; some turned turtle at their docks and went down
in the mud. Some led long and honorable lives, and others,
beginning with glory, degenerated into cattle-ships or coastal
tramps.</p>
<p>People were but ships and bound for as many destinations
and destinies. Their fates depended as much and yet as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
little on their pilots and engineers, their engines and their
frames. The test of the ship and of the person was the daily
drudgery and the unforeseen emergency.</p>
<p>Davidge believed in preliminary tests of people and boats.
Before he hired a man or trusted a partner he inquired into his
past performances. He had been unable to insist on investigation
in the recent mad scramble for labor due to the sudden
withdrawal into the national army of nearly every male
between twenty-one and thirty-one and of hundreds of
thousands of volunteers of other ages.</p>
<p>He had given his heart to Marie Louise Webling, of whom
he knew little except that she would not tell him much.
And on her dubious voucher he had taken Jake Nuddle into
his employ. Now he had to accept them as he had to accept
steel, taking it as it came and being glad to get any at all.</p>
<p>Hitherto he had insisted on preliminary proofs. He wanted
no steel in a ship&rsquo;s hull or in any part of her that had not
behaved well in the shop tests, in the various machines that
put the metal under bending stress, cross-breaking, hammering,
drifting, shearing, elongation, contraction, compression,
deflection, tension, and torsion stresses. The best of the
steels had their elastic limits; there was none that did not
finally snap.</p>
<p>Once this point was found, the individual metal was placed
according to its quality, the responsibility imposed on it being
only a tenth of its proved capacity. That ought to have been
enough of a margin of safety. Yet it did not prevent disasters.</p>
<p>People could not always be put to such shop tests beforehand.
A reference or two, a snap judgment based on first
impressions, ushered a man or a woman into a place where
weakness or malice could do incalculable harm. In every
institution, as in every structure, these danger-spots exist.
Davidge, for all his care and knowledge of people, could
only take the best he could get.</p>
<p>Jake Nuddle had got past the sentry-line with ludicrous
ease and had contrived already the ruin of one ship. His
program, which included all the others, had had a little setback,
but he could easily regain his lost ground, for the
mob had vented its rage against him and was appeased.</p>
<p>Mamise was inside the sentry-lines, too, both of Davidge&rsquo;s
shop and his heart. Her purposes were loyal, but she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
drifting toward a supreme stress that should try her inmost
fiber. And at the moment she felt an almost unbearable
strain in the petty decision of whether to go with the clerks
or stop with the boss.</p>
<p>Mamise was not so much afraid of what the clerks would
say of her. It was Davidge that she was protecting. She
did not want to have them talking about him&ndash;&ndash;as if anything
could have stopped them from that!</p>
<p>While she debated between being unselfish enough to leave
him unconsoled and being selfish enough to stay, she spent
so much time that the outer office was empty, anyway.</p>
<p>Seeing herself alone, she made a quick motion toward the
door. Miss Gabus came out, stared violently, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was you goin&rsquo; in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;oh no!&rdquo; said Mamise. &ldquo;I left something in my
desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her desk, took out a pencil-nub and hurried
away, ostentatiously passing the other clerks as they struggled
across the yard to the gate.</p>
<p>She walked to her shanty and found it all pins and needles.
She was so desperate that she went to see her sister.</p>
<p>Marie Louise found Abbie in her kitchen, sewing buttons
on the extremely personal property of certain bachelors whom
she washed for in spite of Jake&rsquo;s high earnings&ndash;&ndash;from which
she benefited no more than before. If Jake had come into a
million, or shattered the world to bits and then rebuilt it
nearer to his heart&rsquo;s desire, he would not have had enough to
make much difference to Abbie. Mamise had made many
handsome presents to Abbie, but somehow they vanished, or
at least got Abbie no farther along the road to contentment
or grace.</p>
<p>Mamise was full of the story of the disaster to the <i>Clara</i>. She
drew Abbie into the living-room away from the children, who
were playing in the kitchen because it was full of the savor of
the forthcoming supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abbie dear, have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie gasped, &ldquo;Oh God, is anything happened to Jake&ndash;&ndash;killed
or arrested or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&ndash;&ndash;but <i>Clara</i>&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Clara</i>&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship, the first ship we built, she&rsquo;s destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake! I want to know! Well, what you
know about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie could not rise to very lofty heights of emotion or
language over anything impersonal. She made hardly so
much noise over this tragedy as a hen does over the delivery
of an egg.</p>
<p>Mamise was distressed by her stolidity. She understood
with regret why Jake did not find Abbie an ideal inspirational
companion. She hated to think well of Jake or ill of her
sister, but one cannot help receiving impressions.</p>
<p>She did her best to stimulate Abbie to a decent warmth,
but Abbie was as immune to such appeals as those people were
who were still wondering why America went to war with
Germany.</p>
<p>Abbie was entirely perfunctory in her responses to Mamise&rsquo;s
pictures of the atrocity. She grew really indignant when she
looked at the clock and saw that Jake was late to dinner.
She broke in on Mamise&rsquo;s excitement with a distressful:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we got steak &rsquo;n&rsquo; cab&rsquo;ge for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must hurry back to my own shack,&rdquo; said Mamise, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay right where you are. You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to eat with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, thanks, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kept no servant of her own. She enjoyed the circumstance
of getting her meals. She was camping out in her
shanty. To-night she wanted to be busy about something
especially about a kitchen&ndash;&ndash;the machine-shop of the woman
who wants to be puttering at something.</p>
<p>She was dismally lonely, but she was not equal to a supper
at Jake&rsquo;s. She would have liked a few children of her own,
but she was glad that she did not own the Nuddle children,
especially the elder two.</p>
<p>The Nuddles had given three hostages to Fortune. Jake
cared little whether Fortune kept the hostages or not, or
whether or not she treated them as the Germans treated
Belgian hostages.</p>
<p>Little Sister was the oldest of the trio completed by Little
Brother and a middle-sized bear named Sam. Sis and Sam
were juvenile anarchists born with those gifts of mischief,
envy, indolence, and denunciation that Jake and the literary
press-agents of the same spirit flattered as philosophy or even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
as philanthropy. Little Brother was a quiet, patient gnome
with quaint instincts of industry and accumulation. He was
always at work at something. His mud-pie bakery was
famous for two blocks. He gathered bright pebbles and
shells. In the marble season he was a plutocrat in taws and
agates. Being always busy, he always had time to do more
things. He even volunteered to help his mother. When he
got an occasional penny he hoarded it in hiding. He had
need to, for Sam borrowed what he could and stole what he
could not wheedle.</p>
<p>Little Brother was not stingy, but he saved; he bought his
mother petty gifts once in a while when he had enough to pay
for something.</p>
<p>Little Sister and Sam were capable in emotional crises of
sympathy or hatred to express themselves volubly. Little
Brother had no gifts of speech. He made gifts of pebbles or
of money awkwardly, shyly, with few words. Mamise, as
she tried to extricate herself from Abbie&rsquo;s lassoing hospitality,
paused in the door and studied the children, contrasting them
with the Webling grandchildren who had been born with
gold spoons in their mouths and somebody to take them out,
fill them, and put them in again. But luxury seemed to make
small difference in character.</p>
<p>She mused upon the three strange beings that had come
into the world as a result of the chance union of Jake and
Abbie. Without that they would never have existed and the
world would have never known the difference, nor would they.</p>
<p>Sis and Sam were quarreling vigorously. Little Brother
was silent upon the hearth. He had collected from the gutter
many small stones and sticks. They were treasures to him
and he was as important about them as a miser about his
shekels. Again and again he counted them, taking a pleasure
in their arithmetic. Already he was advanced in mathematics
beyond the others and he loved to arrange his wealth
for the sheer delight of arrangement; orderliness was an
instinct with him already.</p>
<p>For a time Mamise noted how solemnly he kept at work,
building a little stone house and painfully making it stand.
He was a home-builder already.</p>
<p>Sam had paid no heed to the work. But, wondering what
Mamise was looking at, he turned and saw his brother. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
grin stretched his mouth. Little Brother grew anxious. He
knew that when something he had builded interested Sam its
doom was close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whass &rsquo;at?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None yer business,&rdquo; said Little Brother, as spunky as
Belgium before the Kaiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S&rsquo;ouse, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lea&rsquo; me &rsquo;lone, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where d&rsquo;you git it at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I built it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You build you one for your own self now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;At one&rsquo;s good enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maw! You make Sam lea&rsquo; my youse alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nuddle moaned: &ldquo;Sammie, don&rsquo;t bother Little
Brother now. You go on about your own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smash! splash! Sam had kicked the house into ruins with
the side of his foot.</p>
<p>Mamise was so angry that before she knew it she had
darted at him and smacked him with violence. Instantly
she was ashamed of herself. Sam began to rub his face and
yowl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maw, she gimme a swipe in the snoot! She hurt me,
so she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was disgusted. Abbie appeared at the door equally
disgusted; it was intolerable that any one should slap her
children but herself. She had accepted too much of Mamise&rsquo;s
money to be very indignant, but she did rise to a wail:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Mamise, you might keep your hands off my
childern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I forgot myself. But Sam is so like his father
I just couldn&rsquo;t help taking a whack at him. The little bully
knocked over his brother&rsquo;s house just to hear it fall. When
he grows up he&rsquo;ll be just as much of a nuisance as Jake and
he&rsquo;ll call it syndicalism or internationalism or something, just
as Jake does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake came in on the scene. He brought home his black
eye and a white story.</p>
<p>When Abbie gasped, &ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he
growled: &ldquo;I bumped into a girder. Whatya s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie accepted the eye as a fact and the story as a fiction,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
but she knew that, however Jake stood in the yard, as a pugilist
he was the home champion.</p>
<p>She called Little Sister to bring from the ice-box a slice of
the steak she had bought for dinner. On the high wages
Jake was earning&ndash;&ndash;or at least receiving&ndash;&ndash;the family was
eating high.</p>
<p>Little Sister told her brother Sam, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to waste
good meat on his old black lamp.&rdquo; And Sam&rsquo;s regret was,
&ldquo;I wisht I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; gave it to um.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Sister knew better than to let her father hear any
of this, but it was only another cruel evidence that great
lovers of the public welfare are apt to be harshly regarded
at home. It is too much to expect that one who tenderly
considers mankind in the mass should have time to be kind
to them in particular.</p>
<p>Jake was not even appreciated by Mamise, whom he did
appreciate. Every time he praised her looks or her swell
clothes she acted as if he made her mad.</p>
<p>To-night when he found her at the house her first gush of
anxiety for him was followed by a remark of singular heartlessness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, oh, did you hear of the destruction of the <i>Clara</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard of the destruction of the <i>Clara</i>,&rdquo; he echoed,
with a sneer. &ldquo;If I had my way the whole rotten fleet
would follow her to the bottom of the ocean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jake!&rdquo; was Abbie&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>Jake went on: &ldquo;And it will, too, or I&rsquo;m a liar. The Germans
will get them boats as fast as they build &rsquo;em.&rdquo; He
laughed. &ldquo;I tell you them Kaiser-boys just eats ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how were they able to destroy the <i>Clara</i>?&rdquo; Mamise
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easiest thing you know. When she laid up at Norfolk
they just put a bomb into her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did they know she was going to Norfolk to load?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&ndash;&ndash;they have ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little slip from &ldquo;we&rdquo; to &ldquo;they&rdquo; caught Mamise&rsquo;s ear.
Her first intuition of its meaning was right, and out of her
amazement the first words that leaped were:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Abbie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thought, like lightning, breaks through the air in a quick
slash from cloud to ground. Mamise&rsquo;s whole thought was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
from zig to zag in some such procedure as this, but infinitely
swift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&ndash;&ndash;they? That means that Jake considers himself a
part of the German organization for destruction, the will
to ruin. That means that Jake must have been involved in
the wreck of the <i>Clara</i>. That means that he deliberately connived
at a crime against his country. That means that he is
a traitor as well as a murderer. That means that my sister
is the wife of a fiend. Poor Abbie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought stunned and blinded Mamise a long moment.
She heard Jake grumbling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ya mean&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;poor Abbie!&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was afraid to say. She cast one glance at Jake,
and the lightning of understanding struck him. He realized
what she was thinking&ndash;&ndash;or at least he suspected it, because
he was thinking of his own past. He was realizing that he
had met Nicky Easton through Mamise, though Mamise
did not know this&ndash;&ndash;that is, he hoped she did not. And yet
perhaps she did.</p>
<p>And now Mamise and Jake were mutually afraid of each
other. Abbie was altogether in the dark, and a little jealous
of Mamise and her peculiar secrets, but her general mood was
one of stolid thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>Jake, suspecting Mamise&rsquo;s suspicion of him, was moved to
justify himself by one of his tirades against society in general.
Abbie, who had about as much confidence in the world as an
old rabbit in a doggy country, had heard Jake thunder so
often that his denunciations had become as vaguely lulling
as a continual surf. Generalizations meant nothing to her
bovine soul. She was thinking of something else, usually,
throughout all the fiery Jakiads. While he indicted whole
nations and denounced all success as a crime against unsuccess
she was hunting through her work-basket for a good thread
to patch Sam&rsquo;s pants with.</p>
<p>Abbie was unmoved, but Mamise was appalled. It was
her first encounter with the abysmal hatred of which some of
these loud lovers of mankind are capable. Jake&rsquo;s theories
had been merely absurd or annoying before, but now they
grew monstrous, for they seemed to be confirmed by an actual
crime.</p>
<p>Mamise felt that she must escape from the presence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Jake or attack him. She despised him too well to argue with
him, and she rose to go.</p>
<p>Abbie pleaded with her in vain to stay to supper. She
would not be persuaded. She walked to her own bungalow
and cooked herself a little meal of her own. She felt stained
once more with vicarious guilt, and wondered what she had
done so to be pursued and lassoed by the crimes of others.</p>
<p>She remembered that she had lost her chance to clear herself
of Sir Joseph Webling&rsquo;s guilt by keeping his secret. If she
had gone to the British authorities with her first suspicion of
Sir Joseph and Nicky Easton she would have escaped from
sharing their guilt. She would have been branded as an
informer, but only by the conspirators; and Sir Joseph himself
and Lady Webling might have been saved from self-destruction.</p>
<p>Now she was in the same situation almost exactly. Again
she had only suspicion for her guide. But in England she
had been a foreigner and Sir Joseph was her benefactor. Here
she was in her own country, and she owed nothing to Jake
Nuddle, who was a low brute, as ruthless to his wife as to his
flag.</p>
<p>It came to Mamise with a sharp suddenness that her one
clear duty was to tell Davidge what she knew about Jake.
It was not a pretty duty, but it was a definite. She resolved
that the first thing she did in the morning would be to go to
Davidge with what facts she had. The resolution brought
her peace, and she sat down to her meager supper with a
sense of pleasant righteousness.</p>
<p>Mamise felt so redeemed that she took up a novel, lighted
a cigarette, and sat down by her lamp to pass a well-earned
evening of spinsterial respectability. Then the door opened
and Abbie walked in. Abbie did not think it sisterly to
knock. She paused to register her formal protest against
Mamise&rsquo;s wicked addiction to tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say, Mamise, I do wisht you&rsquo;d break yourself of
that horbul habbut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise laughed tolerantly. &ldquo;You were cooking cabbage
when I was at your house. Why can&rsquo;t I cook this vegetable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t cooking the cabbage in my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were cooking it in mine. But let&rsquo;s not argue about
botany or ethics.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>Abbie was not aware of mentioning either of those things,
but she had other matters to discuss. She dropped into a
chair, sighing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake&rsquo;s went out to telephone, and I thought I&rsquo;d just
run over for a few words. You see, I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was Jake telephoning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I d&rsquo;know. He&rsquo;s always long-distancin&rsquo; somebody. But
what I come for&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it ever occur to you to wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long as it ain&rsquo;t some woman&ndash;&ndash;or if it is, as long as it&rsquo;s
long distance&ndash;&ndash;why should I worry my head about it? The
thing I wanted to speak of is&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it rather make your blood run cold to hear Jake
speak as he did of the lost ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so used to his rantin&rsquo; it goes in one ear and out
the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep a little of it in your brain. I&rsquo;m worried
about your husband, even if you&rsquo;re not, Abbie dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What call you got to worry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a ghastly feeling that my brother-in-law is mixed
up in the sinking of the <i>Clara</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to be. But do you remember the night
I told you both that the <i>Clara</i> was going to Norfolk to take
on her cargo? Well, he went out to get cigars, though he had
a lot, and he let it slip that he had been talking on the long-distance
telephone. When the <i>Clara</i> is sunk, he is not surprised.
He says, &lsquo;We&ndash;&ndash;they have ways.&rsquo; He prophesies the
sinking of all the ships Mr. Davidge&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie seized this name as a weapon of self-defense and
mate-defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re speakin&rsquo; for Mr. Davidge now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. He&rsquo;s my employer, and Jake&rsquo;s, too. I feel
under some obligations to him, even though Jake doesn&rsquo;t.
I feel some obligations to the United States, and Jake doesn&rsquo;t.
I distrust and abhor Germany, and Jake likes her as well as
he does us. The background is perfect. When such crimes
are being done as Germany keeps doing, condoning them is as
bad as committing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big words!&rdquo; sniffed Abbie. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you talk United
States?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my dear. I say that since Jake is glad the
<i>Clara</i> was sunk and hopes that more ships will be sunk, he
is as bad as the men that sank her. And what&rsquo;s more, I
have made up my mind that Jake helped to sink her, and
that he works in this yard simply for a chance to sink more
ships. Do you get those words of one syllable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Abbie. Ideas of one syllable are as hard to
grasp as words of many. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
drivin&rsquo; at a tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Abbie!&rdquo; sighed Mamise. &ldquo;Dream on, if you want
to. But I&rsquo;m going to tell Mr. Davidge to keep a watch on
Jake. I&rsquo;m going to warn him that Jake is probably mixed
up in the sinking of that beautiful ship he named after his
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Abbie could not miss the frightful meaning of this.
She was one of those who never trust experience, one of those
who think that, in spite of all the horrible facts of the past,
horrible things are impossible in the future. Higher types of
the same mind had gone about saying that war was impossible,
later insisting that it was impossible that the United States
should be dragged into this war because it was so horrible,
and next averring that since this war was so horrible there
could never be another.</p>
<p>Even Abbie could imagine what would happen if Mamise
denounced Jake as an accomplice in the sinking of the Clara.
It would be so terrible that it must be impossible. The proof
that Jake was innocent was the thought of what would happen
to him and to her and their children if he were found guilty.
She summed it all up in a phrase:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamise, you&rsquo;re plumb crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, but I&rsquo;m also crazy enough to put Mr. Davidge
on his guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have him fire Jake, or get him arrested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got any sense of decency or dooty a tall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I always knew a woman who&rsquo;d smoke cigarettes
would do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course you won&rsquo;t; but if you did, I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;why, I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;why,
I just don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you give up Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up Jake? Divorce him or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise nodded.</p>
<p>Abbie gasped: &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re positively immor&rsquo;l! Posi-<i>tive</i>-ly!
He&rsquo;s the father of my childern! I&rsquo;ll stick to Jake
through thick and thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through treason and murder, too? You were an American,
you know, before you ever met him. And I was an
American before he became my brother-in-law. And I don&rsquo;t
intend to let him make me a partner in his guilt just because
he made you give him a few children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen to another word,&rdquo; cried Abbie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
too indecent to talk to.&rdquo; And she slammed the door after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Abbie!&rdquo; said Mamise, and closed her book, rubbed
the light out of her cigarette, and went to bed.</p>
<p>But not to sleep. Abbie had not argued well, but sometimes
that is best for the arguments, for then the judge becomes
their attorney. Mamise tossed on a grid of perplexities.
Neither her mind nor her body could find comfort.</p>
<p>She rose early to escape her thoughts. It was a cold, raw
morning, and Abbie came dashing through the drizzle with
her shawl over her head and her cheeks besprent with tears
and rain. She flung herself on Mamise and sobbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t slep&rsquo; a wink all night. I been thinkin&rsquo; of Jake and
the childern. I was mad at you last night, but I&rsquo;m sorry
for what I said. You&rsquo;re my own sister&ndash;&ndash;all I got in the world
besides the three childern. And I&rsquo;m all you got, and I
know it ain&rsquo;t in you to go and send the father o&rsquo; my childern
to jail and ruin my life. I&rsquo;ve had a hard life, and so&rsquo;ve
you, Mamise honey, but we got to be friends and love one
another, for we&rsquo;re all that&rsquo;s left of our fambly, and it couldn&rsquo;t
be that one sister would drive the other to distraction and
drag the family name in the mud. It couldn&rsquo;t be, could it,
Mamise? Tell me you was only teasin&rsquo; me! I didn&rsquo;t mean
what I said last night about you bein&rsquo; indecent, and you
didn&rsquo;t mean what you said about Jake, did you, Mamise?
Say you didn&rsquo;t, or I&rsquo;ll just die right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had left the door open, and a gust of windy rain came
lashing in. The world outside was cold and wet, and Abbie
was warm and afraid and irresistibly pitiful.</p>
<p>Mamise could only hug and kiss her and say:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see! I&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When people do not know what their chief mysteries,
themselves, will do they say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise thought of Davidge, and she could not promise
to leave him in ignorance of the menace imminent above
him. But when at last she tore herself from Abbie&rsquo;s clutching
hands and hurried away to the office she looked back and saw
Abbie out in the rain, staring after her in terror and shaking
her head helplessly. She could not promise herself that she
would tell Davidge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>She reached the office late in spite of her early start.
Davidge had gone. He had gone to Pittsburgh to try
to plead for more steel for more ships.</p>
<p>The head clerk told her this. He was in an ugly mood,
sarcastic about Mamise&rsquo;s tardiness, and bitter with the
knowledge that all the work of building another <i>Clara</i> had
to be carried through with its endless detail and the chance
of the same futility. He was as sick about it as a Carlyle
who must rewrite a burned-up history, an Audubon who
must repaint all his pictures.</p>
<p>Davidge had left no good-by for Mamise. This hurt her.
She wished that she had stopped to tell him good night the
afternoon before.</p>
<p>In his prolonged absence Mamise wondered if he were really
in Pittsburgh or in Washington with Lady Clifton-Wyatt.
She experienced the first luxury of jealousy; it was aggravated
by alarm. She was left alone, a prey to the appeals of Abbie,
who could not persuade her to promise silence.</p>
<p>But the next night Jake was gone. Abbie explained that
he had been called out of town to a meeting of a committee
of his benevolent insurance order. Mamise wondered and
surmised.</p>
<p>Jake went to meet Nicky Easton and claim his pay for his
share in the elimination of the <i>Clara</i>. Nicky paid him so
handsomely that Jake lost his head and imagined himself
already a millionaire. Strangely, he did not at once set
about dividing his wealth among his beloved &ldquo;protelariat.&rdquo;
He made a royal progress from saloon to saloon, growing more
and more haughty, and pounding on successive bars with a
vigor that increased as his articulation effervesced. His secret
would probably have bubbled out of him if he had not been so
offensive that he was bounced out of every barroom before he
had time to get to the explanation of his wealth. In one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
&ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s club&rdquo; he fell asleep and rolled off his chair to a
comfortable berth among the spittoons.</p>
<p>Next morning Jake woke up with his head swollen and his
purse vanished. He sought out Nicky and demanded another
fee. Nicky laughed at his claim; but Jake grew threatening,
and Nicky was frightened into offering him a chance to win
another fortune by sinking another ship. He staked Jake to
the fare for his return and promised to motor down some dark
night and confer with him. Jake rolled home in state.</p>
<p>On the same train went a much interested sleuth who
detached himself from the entourage of Nicky and picked up
Jake.</p>
<p>Jake had attracted some attention when he first met
Nicky in Washington, but the sadly overworked Department
of Justice could not provide a squad of escorts for every German
or pro-German suspect. Before the war was over the
secret army under Mr. Bielaski reached a total of two hundred
and fifty thousand, but the number of suspects reached into
the millions. From Nicky Easton alone a dozen activities
radiated; and studying him and his communicants was a
slow and complex task.</p>
<p>Mr. Larrey decided that the best way to get a line on Jake
would be to take a job alongside him and &ldquo;watch his work.&rdquo;
It was the easiest thing in the world to get a job at Davidge&rsquo;s
shipyard; and it was another of the easiest things in the world
to meet Jake, for Jake was eager to meet workmen, particularly
workmen like Larrey, who would listen to reason, and
take an interest in the gentle art of slowing up production.
Larrey was all for sabotage.</p>
<p>One evening Jake invited him to his house for further
development. On that evening Mamise dropped in. She
did not recognize Larrey, but he remembered her perfectly.</p>
<p>He could hardly believe his camera eyes at first when he
saw the great Miss Webling enter a workman&rsquo;s shanty and
accept Jake Nuddle&rsquo;s introduction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Larrey, old scout, this is me sister-in-law. Mamise, shake
hands with me pal Larrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larrey had been the first of her shadows in New York, but
had been called off when she proved unprofitable and before
she met Easton. And now he found her at work in a shipyard
where strange things were happening! He was all afire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
with the covey of spies he had flushed. His first impulse was
to shoot off a wire in code to announce his discovery. Then
he decided to work this gold-mine himself. It would be
pleasanter to cultivate this pretty woman than Jake Nuddle,
and she would probably fall for him like a thousand of brick.
But when he invited himself to call on her her snub fell on
him like a thousand of brick. She would not let him see her
home, and he was furious till Jake explained, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sweet
on the boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larrey decided that he had better call on Davidge and tip
him off to the past of his stenographer and get him to place
her under observation.</p>
<p>The next day Davidge came back from his protracted
journey. He had fought a winning battle for an allotment
of steel. He was boyish with the renewal of battle ardor,
and boyish in his greeting of Mamise. He made no bones
of greeting her before all the clerks with a horribly embarrassing
enthusiasm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! but I&rsquo;ve been homesick to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gabus was disgusted. Mamise was silly with confusion.</p>
<p>Those people who are always afraid of new customs have
dreaded public life for women lest it should destroy modesty
and rob them of the protection of guardians, duennas, and
chaperons. But the world seems to have to have a certain
amount of decency to get along on, at all, and provides for it
among humans about as well as it provides for the protection
of other plants and animals, letting many suffer and perish
and some prosper.</p>
<p>The anxious conservatives who are always risking their own
souls in spasms of anxiety over other people&rsquo;s souls would
have given up Mamise and Davidge for lost, since she lived
alone and he was an unattached bachelor. But curiously
enough, their characters chaperoned them, their jobs and
ambitions excited and fatigued them, and their moods of
temptation either did not coincide or were frustrated by
circumstances and crowds.</p>
<p>Each knew well what it was to suffer an onset of desperate
emotion, of longing, of reckless, helpless adoration. But in
office hours these anguishes were as futile as prayers for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
moon. Outside of office hours there were other obstacles,
embarrassments, interferences.</p>
<p>These protections and ambitions would not suffice forever,
any more than a mother&rsquo;s vigilance, maidenly timidity, convent
walls or <i>yashmaks</i> will infallibly prevail. But they managed
to kill a good deal of time&ndash;&ndash;and very dolefully.</p>
<p>Mamise was in peculiar peril now. She was beginning to
feel very sorry for herself, and even sorrier for Davidge. She
remembered how cruelly he had been bludgeoned by the news
of the destruction of his first ship, and she kept remembering
the wild, sweet pangs of her sympathy, the strange ecstasy
of entering into the grief of another. She remembered how
she had seized his shoulders and how their hands had wrestled
together in a common anguish. The remembrance of that
communion came back to her in flashes of feverish demand
for a renewal of union, for a consummation of it, indeed.
She was human, and nothing human was alien to her.</p>
<p>Davidge had spoken of marriage&ndash;&ndash;had told her that he was
a candidate for her husbandcy. She had laughed at him then,
for her heart had been full of the new wine of ambition.
Like other wines, it had its morning after when all that had
been so alluring looked to be folly. Her own loneliness told
her that Davidge was lonely, and that two lonelinesses combined
would make a festival, as two negatives an affirmative.</p>
<p>When Davidge came back from his trip the joy in his eyes
at sight of her kindled her smoldering to flame. She would
have been glad if he had snatched her to his breast and crushed
her there. She had that womanly longing to be crushed, and
he the man&rsquo;s to crush. But fate provided a sentinel. Miss
Gabus was looking on; the office force stood by, and the day&rsquo;s
work was waiting to be done.</p>
<p>Davidge went to his desk tremulous; Mamise to her typewriter.
She hammered out a devil&rsquo;s tattoo on it, and he
devoured estimates and commercial correspondence, while an
aromatic haze enveloped them both as truly as if they had
been faun and nymph in a bosky glade.</p>
<p>Miss Gabus played Mrs. Grundy all morning and at the noon
hour made a noble effort to rescue Mamise from any opportunity
to cast an evil spell over poor Mr. Davidge. Women
have a wonderful pity for men that other women cultivate!
Yet all that Miss Gabus said to Miss Webling was:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to lunch now, Mi&rsquo; Swebling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all that Miss Webling said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet&ndash;&ndash;thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both were almost swooning with the tremendous significance
of the moment.</p>
<p>Miss Webling felt that she was defying all the powers of
espionage and convention when she made so brave as to linger
while Miss Gabus left the room in short twitches, with the
painful reluctance of one who pulls off an adhesive plaster by
degrees. When at last she was really off, Miss Webling went
to Davidge&rsquo;s door, feeling as wicked as the maid in Ophelia&rsquo;s
song, though she said no more than:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you have a successful journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge whirled in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully! Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought that no goddess had ever done so divine a thing
so ambrosially as she when she smiled and shook her incredibly
exquisite head. He rose to his feet in awe of her. His restless
hands, afraid to lay hold of their quarry, automatically
extracted his watch from his pocket and held it beneath his
eyes. He stared at it without recognizing the hour, and
stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you lunch with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This jolted an &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; out of him. Then he came back with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When am I going to get a chance to talk to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He thought of that horrible evening when
he had marched through the double row of staring cottages.
But he was determined. &ldquo;Going to be home this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By some strange accident&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By some strange accident, I might drop round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed idiotically, and she turned and glided out.</p>
<p>She went to the mess-hall and moved about, selecting her
dishes. Pretending not to see that Miss Gabus was pretending
not to see her, she took her collation to another table
and ate with the relish of a sense of secret guilt&ndash;&ndash;the guilt
of a young woman secretly betrothed.</p>
<p>Davidge kept away from the office most of the afternoon
because Mamise was so intolerably sweet and so tantalizingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
unapproachable. He made a pretext of inspecting the works.
She had a sugary suspicion of his motive, and munched it with
strange comfort.</p>
<p>What might have happened if Davidge had called on her
in her then mood and his could easily be guessed. But there
are usually interventions. The chaperon this time was Mr.
Larrey, the operative of the Department of Justice. He also
had his secret.</p>
<p>He arrived at Davidge&rsquo;s home just as Davidge finished the
composition of his third lawn tie and came down-stairs to go.
When he saw Larrey he was a trifle curt with his visitor.
Thinking him a workman and probably an ambassador from
one of the unions on the usual mission of such ambassadors&ndash;&ndash;more
pay, less hours, or the discharge of some unorganized
laborer&ndash;&ndash;Davidge said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better come round to the office in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come to your office,&rdquo; said Larrey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s open to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, but I can&rsquo;t afford to be seen goin&rsquo; there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! Isn&rsquo;t it respectable enough for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, but&ndash;&ndash;well, I think it&rsquo;s my duty to tip you off to a
little slick work that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on in your establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it keep till to-morrow evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh&ndash;&ndash;I guess so. It&rsquo;s only one of your stenographers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This checked Davidge. By a quaint coincidence he was
about to call on one of his stenographers. Larrey amended
his first statement: &ldquo;Leastways, I&rsquo;ll say she calls herself a
stenographer. But that&rsquo;s only her little camouflage. She&rsquo;s
not on the level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge realized that the stenographer he was wooing was
not on the level. She was in the clouds. But his curiosity
was piqued. He motioned Larrey to a chair and took another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this Miss Webling. Know anything about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something,&rdquo; said Davidge. He was too much amused to
be angry. He thought that Larrey was another of those
amateur detectives who flattered Germany by crediting her
with an omnipresence in evil. He was a faithful reader of
Ellis Parker Butler&rsquo;s famous sleuth, and he grinned at Larrey.
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Philo Gubb, go on. Your story interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larrey reddened. He spoke earnestly, explained who he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
was, showed his credentials, and told what he knew of Miss
Webling. He added what he imagined Davidge knew.</p>
<p>Davidge found the whole thing too preposterous to be
insolent. His chivalry in Mamise&rsquo;s behalf was not aroused,
because he thought that the incident would make a good
story to tell her. He drew Larrey out by affecting amazed
incredulity.</p>
<p>Larrey explained: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an old friend of ours. We got the
word from the British to pick the lady up when she first
landed in this country. She was too slick for us, I guess,
because we never got the goods on her. We gave her up
after a couple of weeks. Then her trail crossed Nicky
Easton&rsquo;s once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Nicky Easton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a German agent she knew in London&ndash;&ndash;great friend
of her adopted father&rsquo;s. The British nabbed him once, but
he split on the gang, and they let him off. Whilst I was
trailin&rsquo; him I ran into a feller named Nuddle&ndash;&ndash;he come up
to see Easton. I followed him here, and lo and behold!
Miss Webling turns up, too! And passin&rsquo; herself off for
Nuddle&rsquo;s sister-in-law! Nuddle&rsquo;s a bad actor, but she&rsquo;s
worse. And she pretends to be a poor workin&rsquo;-girl. Cheese!
You should have seen her in New York all dolled up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge ignored the opportunity to say that he had had the
privilege of seeing Miss Webling all dolled up. He knew why
Mamise was living as she did. It was a combination of lark
and crusade. He nursed Larrey&rsquo;s story along, and asked with
patient amusement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your theory as to her reason for playing such a
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled as he said this, but sobered abruptly when
Larrey explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost a ship not long ago, didn&rsquo;t you? You got other
ships on the ways, ain&rsquo;t you? Well, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you
it&rsquo;s good business for the Huns to slow up or blow up all the
ships they can. Every boat they stop cuts down the supplies
of the Allies just so much. This Miss Webling&rsquo;s adopted
father was in on the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>, and this girl
was, too, probably. She carried messages between old Webling
and Easton, and walked right into a little trap the
British laid for her. She put up a strong fight, and, being an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
American, was let go. But her record got to this country
before she did. You ask me what she&rsquo;s up to. Well, what
should she be up to but the Kaiser&rsquo;s work? She&rsquo;s no stenographer,
and she wouldn&rsquo;t be here playin&rsquo; tunes on a typewriter
unless she had some good business reason. Well, her
business is&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s a ship-wrecker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charge was ridiculous, yet there were confirmations or
seeming confirmations of it. The mere name of Nicky
Easton was a thorn in Davidge&rsquo;s soul. He remembered Easton
in London at Mamise&rsquo;s elbow, and in Washington pursuing
her car and calling her &ldquo;Mees Vapelink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge promised Larrey that he would look into the
matter, and bade him good night with mingled respect and
fear.</p>
<p>When he set out at length to call on Mamise he was grievously
troubled lest he had lost his heart to a clever adventuress.
He despised his suspicions, and yet&ndash;&ndash;somebody had destroyed
his ship. He remembered how shocked she had been by the
news. Yet what else could the worst spy do but pretend to
be deeply worried? Davidge had never liked Jake Nuddle;
Mamise&rsquo;s alleged relationship by marriage did not gain
plausibility on reconsideration. The whim to live in a workman&rsquo;s
cottage was even less convincing.</p>
<p>Mr. Larrey had spoiled Davidge&rsquo;s blissful mood and his
lover&rsquo;s program for the evening. Davidge moved slowly
toward Mamise&rsquo;s cottage, not as a suitor, but as a student.</p>
<p>Larrey shadowed him from force of habit, and saw him
going with reluctant feet, pausing now and then, irresolute.
Davidge was thinking hard, calling himself a fool, now for
trusting Mamise and now for listening to Larrey. To suspect
Mamise was to be a traitor to his love: not to suspect her
was to be a traitor to his common sense and to his beloved
career.</p>
<p>And the Mamise that awaited the belated Davidge was
also in a state of tangled wits. She, too, had dressed with a
finikin care, as Davidge had, neither of them stopping to
think how quaint a custom it is for people who know each
other well and see each other in plain clothes every day to
get themselves up with meticulous skill in the evening like
Christmas parcels for each other&rsquo;s examination. Nature
dresses the birds in the mating season. Mankind with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
aid of the dressmaker and the haberdasher plumes up at
will.</p>
<p>But as C&aelig;sar had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and
Davidge his Larrey, so Mamise had her sister Abbie.</p>
<p>Abbie came in unexpectedly and regarded Mamise&rsquo;s costume
with no illusions except her own cynical ones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you all diked up about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise shrugged her eyebrows, her lips, and her shoulders.</p>
<p>Abbie guessed. &ldquo;That man comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise repeated her previous business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of low neck, don&rsquo;t you think? And your arms
nekked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise drew over her arms a scarf that gave them color
rather than concealment. Abbie scorned the subterfuge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s proper to dress like that for a man to
come callin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think so till you spoke,&rdquo; snapped Mamise in all the
bitterness of the ancient feud between loveliness unashamed
and unlovely shame.</p>
<p>Abbie felt unwelcome. &ldquo;Well, I just dropped over because
Jake&rsquo;s went out to some kind of meetin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With whom? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some of the workmen&ndash;&ndash;a lot of soreheads lookin&rsquo; for
more wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was indignant: &ldquo;The soldiers get thirty dollars
a month on a twenty-four-hour, seven-day shift. Jake gets
more than that a week for loafing round the shop about seven
hours a day. How on earth did you ever tie yourself up to
such a rotten bounder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbie longed for a hot retort, but was merely peevish:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t seen you marryin&rsquo; anything better. I guess
I&rsquo;ll go home. I don&rsquo;t seem to be wanted here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was one of those exact truths that decent people must
immediately deny. Mamise put her arms about Abbie and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, dear&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m a beast. But Jake is such a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She felt Abbie wriggling ominously and changed to: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
so unworthy of you. These are such terrible times, and the
world is in such horrible need of everybody&rsquo;s help and especially
of ships. It breaks my heart to see anybody wasting
his time and strength interfering with the builders instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
joining them. It&rsquo;s like interfering with the soldiers. It&rsquo;s a
kind of treason. And besides, he does so little for you and
the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last Abbie was willing to admit. She shed a few tears
of self-esteem, but she simply could not rise to the heights of
suffering for anything as abstract as a cause or a nation or a
world. She was like so many of the air-ships the United States
was building then: she could not be induced to leave the
ground or, if she got up, to glide back safely.</p>
<p>She tried now to love her country, but she hardly rose before
she fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it&rsquo;s tur&rsquo;ble what folks are sufferin&rsquo;, but&ndash;&ndash;well,
the Lord&rsquo;s will be done, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say it&rsquo;s mainly the devil&rsquo;s will that&rsquo;s being done!&rdquo;
said Mamise.</p>
<p>This terrified Abbie. &ldquo;I wisht you&rsquo;d be a little careful of
your language, Mamise. Swearin&rsquo; and cigarettes both is
pretty much of a load for a lady to git by with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; sighed Mamise, in despair. She was capable of
long, high flights, but she could not carry such a passenger.</p>
<p>Abbie continued: &ldquo;And do you think it&rsquo;s right, seein&rsquo;
men here all by yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not all by myself when he&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get the neighbors talkin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot I care for their talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you marry him and settle down respectable
and have childern and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go home and take care of your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I better.&rdquo; And she departed forthwith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>The two sisters had managed to fray each other&rsquo;s nerves
raw. The mere fact that Abbie advocated marriage and
maternity threw Mamise into a cantankerous distaste for her
own dreams.</p>
<p>Larrey had delayed Davidge long enough for Mamise to be
rid of Abbie, but the influence of both Larrey and Abbie was
manifest in the strained greetings of the caller and the callee.
Instead of the eagerness to rush into each other&rsquo;s arms that
both had felt in the morning, Davidge entered Mamise&rsquo;s
presence with one thought dominant: &ldquo;Is she really a spy?
I must be on my guard.&rdquo; And Mamise was thinking, &ldquo;If he
should be thinking what Abbie thought, how odious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus once more their moods chaperoned them. Love could
not attune them. She sat; he sat. When their glances met
they parted at once.</p>
<p>She mistook his uncertainty for despondency. She assumed
that he was brooding over his lost ship. Out of a
long silence she spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the world will ever forget and forgive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget and forgive who&ndash;&ndash;whom, for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Germany for all she&rsquo;s done to this poor world&ndash;&ndash;Belgium,
the <i>Lusitania</i>, the <i>Clara</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled sadly. &ldquo;The <i>Clara</i> was a little slow tub compared
to the <i>Lusitania</i>, but she meant a lot to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to me. So did the <i>Lusitania</i>. She nearly cost me
my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was startled. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t plan to sail on her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She paused. She had not meant to open
this subject.</p>
<p>But he was aching to hear her version of what Larrey had
told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean&ndash;&ndash;she nearly cost you your life?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s one of the dark chapters of my past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; He said it with a surprising earnestness. He
had a sudden hope that her confession might be an absolving
explanation.</p>
<p>She could not fathom this eagerness, but she felt a desire
to release that old secret. She began, recklessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I told you how I ran away from home and went on
the stage, and Sir Joseph Webling&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that much, but not what happened before
you met him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t tell you that, and I&rsquo;m not going to now, but&ndash;&ndash;well,
Sir Joseph was like a father to me; I never had one of
my own&ndash;&ndash;to know and remember. Sir Joseph was German
born, and perhaps the ruthlessness was contagious, for he&ndash;&ndash;well,
I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swore not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave your oath to a German?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to an English officer in the Secret Service. I&rsquo;m always
forgetting and starting to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take your oath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I traded secrecy for freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you turned state&rsquo;s evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I didn&rsquo;t tell on them. I didn&rsquo;t know what they
were up to when they used me for&ndash;&ndash; But I&rsquo;m skidding now.
I want to tell you&ndash;&ndash;terribly. But I simply must not. I
made an awful mistake that night at Mrs. Prothero&rsquo;s in
pretending to be ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You only pretended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to get you away. You see, Lady Clifton-Wyatt got
after me, accused me of being a spy, of carrying messages that
resulted in the sinking of ships and the killing of men. She
said that the police came to our house, and Sir Joseph tried
to kill one of them and killed his own wife and then was shot
by an officer and that they gave out the story that Sir Joseph
and Lady Webling died of ptomaine poisoning. She said
Nicky Easton was shot in the Tower. Oh, an awful story
she told, and I was afraid she&rsquo;d tell you, so I spirited you
away on the pretext of illness.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>Davidge was astounded at this confirmation of Larrey&rsquo;s
story. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t true what Lady C.-W. told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of it was false, but it was fiction founded on fact,
and I couldn&rsquo;t explain it without breaking my oath. And
now I&rsquo;ve pretty nearly broken it, after all. I&rsquo;ve sprained it
badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to go on and&ndash;&ndash;finish it off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to&ndash;&ndash;oh, how I want to! but I&rsquo;ve got to save a few
shreds of respectability. I kidnapped you the day you were
going to tea with Lady C.-W. to keep you from her. I wish
now I&rsquo;d let you go. Then you&rsquo;d have known the worst of
me&ndash;&ndash;or worse than the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned a harrowed glance his way, and saw, to her
bewilderment, that he was smiling broadly. Then he seized
her hands and felt a need to gather her home to his arms.</p>
<p>She was so amazed that she fell back to stare at him.
Studying his radiant face, she somehow guessed that he had
known part of her story before and was glad to hear her
confess it, but her intuition missed fire when she guessed at the
source of his information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been talking to Lady Clifton-Wyatt, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since I saw her with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed now, for it pleased him mightily to have her
read his heart so true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The main thing is that you told me. And now once more
I ask you: will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This startled her indeed. She startled him no less by her
brusquerie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll marry no man who is so careless whom he marries
as you are.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>The whimsical solemnity of this made him roar. But a
man does not love a woman the less for being feminine,
and when she thwarts him by a womanliness she delights him
excruciatingly.</p>
<p>But Mamise was in earnest. She believed in one emotion
at a time. It offended her to have Davidge suggest that the
funeral baked meats of her tragedy should coldly furnish
forth a wedding breakfast. She wanted to revel awhile
in her elegiac humor and pay full honor to her sorrow, full
penalty for her guilt. She put aside his amorous impatience
and returned to her theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after all the evil I have done, I wanted to make
some atonement. I was involved in the sinking of I don&rsquo;t
know how many ships, and I wanted to take some part in
building others. So when I met you and you told me that
women could build ships, too, you wakened a great hope in
me, and an ambition. I wanted to get out in the yards and
swing a sledge or drive a riveting-gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With those hands?&rdquo; He laughed and reached for them.</p>
<p>She put them out of sight back of her as one removes
dangerous toys from the clutch of a child, and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t let me. So I took up the next best
thing, office work. I studied that hateful stenography and
learned to play a typewriter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It keeps you nearer to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be near you. I want to build ships.
Please let me go out in the yard. Please give me a real job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not keep from laughing at her, at such delicacy
pleading for such toil. His amusement humiliated her and
baffled her so that at length she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go on home. It&rsquo;s getting late, and I don&rsquo;t like
you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like me, but couldn&rsquo;t you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more impossible than liking you, since you won&rsquo;t
let me have my only wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too brutal, I tell you. And it&rsquo;s getting too cold.
It would simply ruin your perfect skin. I don&rsquo;t want to
marry a longshoreman, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll thank you to go on home. I&rsquo;m tired out. I&rsquo;ve
got to get up in the morning at the screech of dawn and take
up your ghastly drudgery again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll marry me you won&rsquo;t have to work at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But work is the one thing I want. So if you&rsquo;ll kindly take
yourself off I&rsquo;ll be much obliged. You&rsquo;ve no business here,
anyway, and it&rsquo;s getting so late that you&rsquo;ll have all the
neighbors talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot I care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I care a lot,&rdquo; she said, blandly belying her words
to Abbie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to live among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a miserable ending to an evening of such promise.
He felt as sheepish as a cub turned out of his best girl&rsquo;s house
by a sleepy parent, but he had no choice. He rose drearily,
fought his way into his overcoat, and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; and wished that she were not
so cantankerous. The closing of the door shook her whole
frame, and she made a step forward to call him back, but sank
into a chair instead, worn out with the general unsatisfactoriness
of life, the complicated mathematical problem that
never comes out even. Marriage is a circle that cannot be
quite squared.</p>
<p>She sat droopily in her chair for a long while, pondering
mankind and womankind and their mutual dependence and
incompatibility. It would be nice to be married if one could
stay single at the same time. But it was hopelessly impossible
to eat your cake and have it, too.</p>
<p>Abbie, watching from her window and not knowing that
Davidge had gone, imagined all sorts of things and wished that
her wild sister would marry and settle down. And yet she
wished that she herself had stayed single, for the children
were a torment, and of her husband she could only say that
she did not know whether he bothered her the more when
he was away or when he was at home.</p>
<p>When Davidge left Mamise he looked back at the lonely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
cottage she stubbornly and miserably occupied and longed
to hale her from it into a palace. As he walked home his
heart warmed to all the little cottages, most of them dark and
cheerless, and he longed to change all these to palaces, too. He
felt sorry for the poor, tired people that lived so humbly there
and slept now but to rise in the morning to begin moiling again.</p>
<p>Sometimes from his office window he surveyed the long lines
at the pay-windows and felt proud that he could pour so
much treasure into the hands of the poor. If he had not
schemed and borrowed and organized they would not have
had their wages at all.</p>
<p>But now he wished that there might be no poor and no
wages, but everybody palaced and living on money from home.
That seemed to be the idea, too, of his more discontented
working-men, but he could not imagine how everybody could
have a palace and everybody live at ease. Who was to build
the palaces? Who was to cut the marble from the mountains
and haul it, and who to dig the foundations and blast the
steel and fasten the girders together? It was easy for the
dreamers and the literary loafers and the irresponsible cartoonists
to denounce the capitalists and draw pictures of them
as obese swine wallowing in bags of gold while emaciated children
put out their lean hands in vain. But cartoons were not
construction, and the men who would revolutionize the world
could not, as a rule, keep their own books straight.</p>
<p>Material riches were everywhere, provided one had the
mental riches to go out and get them. Davidge had been as
poor as the poorest man at his works, but he had sold muscle
for money and brains for money. He had dreamed and
schemed and drawn up tremendous plans while they took their
pay and went home to their evenings of repose in the bosoms
of their families or the barrooms of idleness.</p>
<p>Still there was no convincing them of the realization that
they could not get capital by slandering capitalists, or ease
by ease, but only by sweat. And so everybody was saying
that as soon as this great war was over a greater war was
coming upon the world. He wondered what could be done
to stay that universal fury from destroying utterly all that
the German horror might spare.</p>
<p>Thinking of such things, he forgot, for the nonce, the pangs
of love.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>The threat of winter was terrifying the long-suffering
world. People thought of the gales that would harass
the poor souls in the clammy trenches, the icy winds that
would flutter the tents of the men in camps, the sleety storms
that would lash the workers on the docks and on the decks
of ships and in the shipyards; the final relentless persecution
of the refugees, crowded upon the towns that had not enough
for themselves.</p>
<p>To be cold when one is despondent is a fearsome thing.
Mamise woke in the chill little cottage and had to leap from
her snug bed to a cold bathroom, come out chattering to a cold
kitchen. Just as her house grew a little warm, she had to
leave it for a long, windy walk to an office not half warm
enough.</p>
<p>The air was full of orphan leaves, and Cossack whirlwinds
stampeded them down the roads as ruthlessly as Uhlans
herding Belgian fugitives along. The dour autumn seemed
to wrench hopes from the heart like shriveled leaves, and to
fill the air with swirling discouragements. The men at work
about the ships were numb and often stopped to blow upon
their aching fingers. The red-hot rivets went in showers that
threatened to blister, but gave no warmth.</p>
<p>The ambitions of Mamise congealed along with the other
stirring things. She was sorely tempted to give up the unwomanly
battle and accept Davidge&rsquo;s offer of a wedding-ring.
She had, of course, her Webling inheritance to fall
back upon, but she had come to hate it so as tainted money
that she would not touch it or its interest. She put it all
into Liberty Bonds and gave a good many of those to various
charities. Not the least of her delights in her new career had
been her emancipation from slavery to the money Mr. Verrinder
had spoken of as her wages for aiding Sir Joseph
Webling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>A marriage with Davidge was an altogether different slavery,
a thoroughly patriotic livelihood. It would permit her to have
servants to wait on her and build her fires. She would go
out only when she wished, and sleep late of mornings. She
would have multitudinous furs and a closed and heated limousine
to carry her through the white world. She could salve
her conscience by taking up some of the more comfortable
forms of war work. She could manage a Red Cross bandage-factory
or a knitting-room or serve hot dishes in a cozy canteen.</p>
<p>At times from sheer creature discomfort she inclined toward
matrimony, as many another woman has done. These
craven moods alternated with periods of self-rebuke. She
told herself that such a marriage would dishonor her and cheat
Davidge.</p>
<p>Besides, marriage was not all wedding-bells and luxury; it
had its gall as well as its honey. Even in divorceful America
marriage still possesses for women a certain finality. Only one
marriage in nine ended in divorce that year.</p>
<p>Mamise knew men and women, married, single, and betwixt.
She was far, indeed, from that more or less imaginary character
so frequent in fiction and so rare in reality, the young
woman who knows nothing of life and mankind. Like every
other woman that ever lived, she knew a good deal more
than she would confess, and had had more experience than she
would admit under oath. In fact, she did not deny that she
knew more than she wished she knew, and Davidge had
found her very tantalizing about just how much her experience
totaled up.</p>
<p>She had observed the enormous difference between a man
and a woman who meet occasionally and the same people
chained together interminably. Quail is a delicacy for invalids
and gourmets, but notoriously intolerable as a steady
diet. On the other hand, bread is forever good. One never
tires of bread. And a lucky marriage is as perennially refreshing
as bread and butter. The maddening thing about
marriage is what makes other lotteries irresistible: after all,
capital prizes do exist, and some people get them.</p>
<p>Mamise had seen happy mates, rich and poor. In her
lonelier hours she coveted their dual blessedness, enriched
with joys and griefs shared in plenty and in privation.</p>
<p>Mamise liked Davidge better than she had ever liked any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
other man. She supposed she loved him. Sometimes she
longed for him with a kind of ferocity. Then she was afraid
of him, of what he would be like as a husband, of what she
would be like as a wife.</p>
<p>Mamise was in an absolute chaos of mind, afraid of everything
and everybody, from the weather to wedlock. She had
been lured into an office by the fascinating advertisements of
freedom, a career, achievement, doing-your-bit and other
catchwords. She had found that business has its boredoms
no less than the prison walls of home, commerce its treadmills
and its oakum-picking no less than the jail. The cozy little
cottage and the pleasant chores of solitude began to nag her
soul.</p>
<p>The destruction of the good ship <i>Clara</i> had dealt her a
heavier blow than she at first realized, for the mind suffers
from obscure internal injuries as the body does after a great
shock. She understood what bitter tragedies threaten the
business man no less than the monarch, the warrior, the poet,
and the lover, though there has not been many an &AElig;schylos
or Euripides or Dante to make poetry of the Prometheus
chained to the rocks of trade with the vulture pay-roll gnawing
at his profits; the &OElig;dipos in the factory who sees everything
gone horribly awry; or the slow pilgrim through the business
hell with all the infernal variations of bankruptcy, strikes,
panics, and competition.</p>
<p>The blowing up of the <i>Clara</i> had revealed the pitiful truth
that men may toil like swarming bees upon a painful and
costly structure, only to see it all annulled at once by a
careless or a malicious stranger. The <i>Clara</i> served as a warning
that the ship <i>Mamise</i> now on the stocks and growing
ever so slowly might be never finished, or destroyed as soon
as done. A pall of discontent was gathering about her.
It was the turn of that season in her calendar. The weather
was conspiring with the inner November.</p>
<p>The infamous winter of 1917-18 was preparing to descend
upon the blackest year in human annals. Everybody was
unhappy; there was a frightful shortage of food among all
nations, a terrifying shortage of coal, and the lowest temperature
ever known would be recorded. America, less
unfortunate than the other peoples, was bitterly disappointed
in herself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>There was food in plenty for America, but not for her confederates.
The prices were appalling. Wages went up and up,
but never quite caught the expenses. It was necessary to
send enormous quantities of everything to our allies lest
they perish before we could arrive with troops. And Germany
went on fiendishly destroying ships, foodstuffs, and capital,
displaying in every victory a more insatiable cruelty, a more
revolting cynicism toward justice, mercy, or truth.</p>
<p>The Kaiserly contempt for America&rsquo;s importance seemed
to be justified. People were beginning to remember Rome,
and to wonder if, after all, Germany might not crush France
and England with the troops that had demolished Russia.
And then America would have to fight alone.</p>
<p>At this time Mamise stumbled upon an old magazine of the
ancient date of 1914. It was full of prophecies that the
Kaiser would be dethroned, exiled, hanged, perhaps. The
irony of it was ghastly. Nothing was more impossible than
the downfall of the Kaiser&ndash;&ndash;who seemed verifying his boasts
that he took his crown from God. He was praising the strong
sword of the unconquerable Germany. He was marshaling
the millions from his eastern front to throw the British troops
into the sea and smother the France he had bled white. The
best that the most hopeful could do was to mutter: &ldquo;Hurry!
hurry! We&rsquo;ve got to hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise grew fretful about the delay to the ship that was
to take her name across the sea. She went to Davidge to
protest: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hurry up my ship? If she isn&rsquo;t launched
soon I&rsquo;m going to go mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge threw back his head and emitted a noise between
laughter and profanity. He picked up a letter and flung it
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got orders changing the specifications again.
This is the third time, and the third time&rsquo;s the charm; for now
we&rsquo;ve got to take out all we&rsquo;ve put in, make a new set of
drawings and a new set of castings and pretty blamed near
tear down the whole ship and rebuild it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Heaven, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of hades, because we&rsquo;ve got to get a herd of
railroad locomotives to France, and sending them over in
pieces won&rsquo;t do. They want &rsquo;em ready to run. So the
powers that be have ordered me to provide two hatchways
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
big enough to lower whole locomotives through, and pigeonholes
in the hold big enough to carry them. As far as the
<i>Mamise</i> is concerned, that means we&rsquo;ve just about got to
rub it out and do it over again. It&rsquo;s a case of back to the
mold-loft for <i>Mamise</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about how much more delay will this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about ninety days or thereabouts. If we&rsquo;re lucky
we&rsquo;ll launch her by spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was almost worse than the death of the <i>Clara</i>. That
tragedy had been noble; it dealt a noble blow and woke the
heart to a noble grief and courage. But deferment made the
heart sick, and the brain and almost the stomach.</p>
<p>Davidge liked the disappointment no better than Mamise
did, but he was used to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now aren&rsquo;t you glad you&rsquo;re not a ship-builder?
How would you feel if you had got your wish to work in the
yard and had turned your little velvet hands into a pair of
nutmeg-graters by driving about ten thousand rivets into
those plates, only to have to cut &rsquo;em all out again and drive
&rsquo;em into an entirely new set of plates, knowing that maybe
they&rsquo;d have to come out another time and go back? How&rsquo;d
you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise lifted her shoulders and let them fall.</p>
<p>Davidge went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a business man&rsquo;s life, my dear&ndash;&ndash;eternally making
things that won&rsquo;t sell, putting his soul and his capital and his
preparation into a pile of stock that nobody will take off his
hands. But he has to go right on, borrowing money and
pledging the past for the future and never knowing whether
his dreams will turn out to be dollars or&ndash;&ndash;junk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise realized for the first time the pathos, the higher
drama of the manufacturer&rsquo;s world, that world which poets
and some other literary artists do not describe because they
are too ignorant, too petty, too bookish. They sneer at the
noble word <i>commercial</i> as if it were a reproach!</p>
<p>Mamise, however, looked on Davidge in his swivel-chair
as a kind of despondent demigod, a Titan weary of the eternal
strife. She tried to rise beyond a poetical height to the clouds
of the practical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with all the workmen who are on that
job?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>Davidge grinned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re announcing their monthly
strike for higher wages&ndash;&ndash;threatening to lay off the force.
It&rsquo;d serve &rsquo;em right to take &rsquo;em at their word for a while.
But you simply can&rsquo;t fight a labor union according to Queensbery
rules, so I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em the raise and put &rsquo;em on another
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the <i>Mamise</i> will be idle and neglected for three
months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Germans couldn&rsquo;t have done much worse by her, could
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll call it a day and go home,&rdquo; said Mamise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better call it a quarter and go to New York or Palm
Beach or somewhere where there&rsquo;s a little gaiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sick of seeing me round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you won&rsquo;t marry me&ndash;&ndash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise sniffed at this and set her little desk in order,
aligned the pencils in the tray, put the carbons back in the
box and the rubber cover on the typewriter. Then she sank
it into its well and put on her hat.</p>
<p>Davidge held her heavy coat for her and could not resist
the opportunity to fold her into his arms. Just as his arms
closed about her and he opened his lips to beg her not to
desert him he saw over her shoulder the door opening.</p>
<p>He had barely time to release her and pretend to be still
holding her coat when Miss Gabus entered. His elaborate
guiltlessness confirmed her bitterest suspicions, and she crossed
the room to deposit a sheaf of letters in Davidge&rsquo;s &ldquo;in&rdquo; basket
and gather up the letters in his &ldquo;out&rdquo; basket. She passed
across the stage with an effect of absolute refrigeration, like
one of Richard III&rsquo;s ghosts.</p>
<p>Davidge was furious at Miss Gabus and himself. Mamise
was furious at them both&ndash;&ndash;partly for the awkwardness of the
incident, partly for the failure of Davidge&rsquo;s enterprise against
her lips.</p>
<p>When Miss Gabus was gone the ecstatic momentum was
lost. Davidge grumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I see you to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mamise.</p>
<p>She gave him her hand. He pressed it in his two palms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
and shook his head. She shook her head. They were both
rebuking the bad behavior of the fates.</p>
<p>Mamise trudged homeward&ndash;&ndash;or at least houseward. She
was in another of her irresolute states, and irresolution is the
most disappointing of all the moods to the irresolute ones
and all the neighbors. It was irresolution that made &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;
a five-act play, and only a Shakespeare could have kept
him endurable.</p>
<p>Mamise was becoming unendurable to herself. When she
got to her cottage she found it as dismal as an empty ice-box.
When she had started the fire going she had nothing
else to do. In sheer desperation she decided to answer a few
letters. There was an old one from Polly Widdicombe.
She read it again. It contained the usual invitation to come
back to reason and Washington.</p>
<p>Just for something positive to do she resolved to go. There
was a tonic in the mere act of decision. She wrote a letter.
She felt that she could not wait so long as its answer would
require. She resolved to send a telegram.</p>
<p>This meant hustling out into the cold again, but it was
something to do, somewhere to go, some excuse for a hope.</p>
<p>Polly telegraphed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come without fail dying to see you bring along a scuttle of coal if you can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mamise showed Davidge the telegram. He was very
plucky about letting her go. For her sake he was so glad
that he concealed his own loneliness. That made her underestimate
it. He confirmed her belief that he was glad to be
rid of her by making a lark of her departure. He filled an
old suit-case with coal and insisted on her taking it. The
porter who lugged it along the platform at Washington gave
Mamise a curious look. He supposed that this was one of
those suit-cases full of bottled goods that were coming into
Washington in such multitudes since the town had been
decreed absolutely dry. He shook it and was surprised when
he failed to hear the glug-glug of liquor.</p>
<p>But Polly welcomed the suit-case as if it had been full of
that other form of carbon which women wear in rings and
necklaces. The whole country was underheated. To the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
wheatless, meatless, sweetless days there were added the heatless
months. Major Widdicombe took his breakfasts standing
up in his overcoat. Polly and Mamise had theirs in bed,
and the maids that brought it wore their heaviest clothes.</p>
<p>There were long lines of petitioners all day at the offices
of the Fuel Administration. But it did little good. All the
shops and theaters were kept shut on Mondays. Country
clubs were closed. Every device to save a lump of coal was
put into legal effect so that the necessary war factories might
run and the ships go over the sea. Soon there would be
gasoleneless Sundays by request, and all the people would
obey. Bills of fare at home and at hotel would be regulated
by law. Restaurants would be fined for serving more than
one meat to one person. Grocers would be fined for selling
too much sugar to a family. Placards, great billboards, and
all the newspapers were filled with counsels to save, save, save,
and buy, buy, buy Bonds, Bonds, Bonds. People grew depressed
at all this effort, all this sacrifice with so little show
of accomplishment.</p>
<p>American troops, except a pitiful few, were still in America
and apparently doomed to stay. This could easily be proved
by mathematics, for there were not ships enough to carry
them and their supplies. The Germans were building up
reserves in France, and they had every advantage of inner
lines. They could hurl an avalanche of men at any one of a
hundred points of the thin Allied line almost without warning,
and wherever they struck the line would split before the
reserves could be rushed up to the crevasse. And once
through, what could stop them? Indeed, the whisper went
about that the Allies had no reserves worth the name. France
and England were literally &ldquo;all in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Success and the hope of success did not make the Germans
meek. They credited God with a share in their achievement
and pinned an Iron Cross on Him, but they kept mortgaging
His resources for the future. Those who had protested that
the war had been forced on a peaceful Germany and that her
majestic fight was all in self-defense came out now to confess&ndash;&ndash;or
rather to boast&ndash;&ndash;that they had planned this triumph all
along; for thirty years they had built and drilled and stored
up reserves. And now they were about to sweep the world
and make it a German planet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>The peaceful Kaiser admitted that he had toiled for this
approaching day of glory. His war-weary, hunger-pinched
subjects were whipped up to further endurance by a brandy
of fiery promises, the prospects of incalculable loot, vast
colonies, mountains of food, and indemnities sky-high. They
were told to be glad that America had come into the war
openly at last, so that her untouched treasure-chest could
pay the bills.</p>
<p>In the whole history of chicken-computation there were
probably never so many fowls counted before they were
hatched&ndash;&ndash;and in the final outcome never such a crackling and
such a stench of rotten eggs.</p>
<p>But no one in those drear days was mad enough to see the
outcome. The strategical experts protested against the wasteful
&ldquo;side-shows&rdquo; in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Saloniki,
and the taking of Jerusalem was counted merely a pretty bit
of Christmas shopping that could not weigh against the fall
of Kerensky, the end of Russian r&eacute;sistance in the Bolshevik
upheaval, and the Italian stampede down their own mountainsides.</p>
<p>Of all the optimists crazy enough to prophesy a speedy
German collapse, no one put his finger on Bulgaria as the
first to break.</p>
<p>So sublime, indeed, was the German confidence that many
in America who had been driven to cover because of their
Teutonic activities before America entered the war began
to dream that they, too, would reap a great reward for their
martyrdom on behalf of the Fatherland.</p>
<p>The premonition of the dawning of <i>Der Tag</i> stirred the
heart of Nicky Easton, of course. He had led for months the
life of a fox in a hunt-club county. Every time he put his
head out he heard the bay of the hounds. He had stolen very
few chickens, and he expected every moment to be pounced
on. But now that he felt assured of a German triumph in a
little while, he began to think of the future. His heart turned
again to Mamise.</p>
<p>His life of hiding and stealing about from place to place
had compelled him to a more ascetic existence than he had
been used to. His German accent did not help him, and he
had found that even those heavy persons known as light
women, though they had no other virtue, had patriotism
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
enough to greet his advances with fierce hostility. His dialect
insulted those who had relinquished the privilege of being
insulted, and they would not soil their open palms with
German-stained money.</p>
<p>In his alliance with Jake Nuddle for the blowing up of the
<i>Clara</i>, and their later communications looking toward the
destruction of other ships, he kept informed of Mamise. He
always asked Jake about her. He was bitterly depressed
by the news that she was &ldquo;sweet on&rdquo; Davidge. He was
exultant when he learned from Jake that she had given up
her work in the office and had gone to Washington. Jake
learned her address from Abbie, and passed it on to Nicky.</p>
<p>Nicky was tempted to steal into Washington and surprise
her. But enemy aliens were forbidden to visit the capital,
and he was afraid to go by train. He had wild visions of
motoring thither and luring her to a ride with him. He
wanted to kidnap her. He might force her to marry him by
threatening to kill her and himself. At least he might make
her his after the classic manner of his fellow-countrymen in
Belgium. But he had not force enough to carry out anything
so masterful. He was a sentimental German, not a warrior.</p>
<p>In his more emotional moods he began to feel a prophetic
sorrow for Marie Louise after the Germans had conquered
the world. She would be regarded as a traitress. She had
been adopted by Sir Joseph Webling and had helped him,
only to abandon the cause and go over to the enemy.</p>
<p>If Nicky could convert her again to loyalty, persuade her
to do some brave deed for the Fatherland in redemption of
her blacksliding, then when <i>Der Tag</i> came he could reveal
what she had done. When in that resurrection day the graves
opened and all the good German spies and propagandists
came forth to be crowned by <i>Gott</i> and the Kaiser, Nicky could
lead Marie Louise to the dual throne, and, describing her
reconciliation to the cause, claim her as his bride. And the
Kaiser would say, &ldquo;<i>Ende gut, alles gut!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never a missionary felt more sanctity in offering salvation
to a lost soul by way of repentance than Nicky felt when he
went to the house of an American friend and had Mamise
called on the long-distance telephone.</p>
<p>Mamise answered, &ldquo;Yes, this is Miss Webling,&rdquo; to the
faint-voiced long-distance operator, and was told to hold the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
wire. She heard: &ldquo;All ready with Washington. Go ahead.&rdquo;
Then she heard a timid query:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallow, hallow! Iss this Miss Vapelink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was shocked at the familiar dialect. She answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Webling, yes. Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;d know my woice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes. I know you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleass to say no names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You evidently know my address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I cannot come by Vashington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can I see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could meet me some place, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important, most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you&ndash;&ndash;only to you. It is for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at this; yet it set her curiosity on fire, as he
hoped it would. He could almost hear her pondering. But
what she asked was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find my address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Chake&ndash;&ndash;Chake Nuttle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not see the wild look that threw her eyes and lips
wide. She had never dreamed of such an acquaintance. The
mere possibility of it set her brain whirling. It seemed to
explain many things, explain them with a horrible clarity.
She dared not reveal her suspicions to Nicky. She said
nothing till she heard him speak again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, you come, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could come here best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Baltimore we could meet once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Where? When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow. I do not know Baltimore good. Ve could
take ride by automobile and talk so. Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; This a little anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow evening. I remember it is a train gets there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
from Vashington about eight. I meet you. Make sure
nobody sees you take that train, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know people follow people sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you alvays, Marie Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goot-py, Marie Louise.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>While Mamise was talking her telephone ear had suffered
several sharp and painful rasps, as if angry rattlesnakes
had wakened in the receiver.</p>
<p>The moment she put it up the bell rang. Supposing that
Nicky had some postscript to add, she lifted the receiver again.
Her ear was as bewildered as your tongue when it expects to
taste one thing and tastes another, for it was Davidge&rsquo;s voice
that spoke, asking for her. She called him by name, and he
growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! is that you? Who was the fascinating stranger
who kept me waiting so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Where are
you now? At the shipyard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m in Washington&ndash;&ndash;ran up on business. Can I see
you to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so&ndash;&ndash;unless we&rsquo;re going out&ndash;&ndash;as I believe we are.
Hold the wire, won&rsquo;t you, while I ask.&rdquo; She came back in
due season to say, &ldquo;Polly says you are to come to dinner and
go to a dance with us afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dance? I&rsquo;m not invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kind of club affair at a hotel. Polly has the right
to take you&ndash;&ndash;no end of big bugs will be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rusty on dancing, but with you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. We&rsquo;ll expect you, then. Dinner is at eight.
Wrap up well. It&rsquo;s cold, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought it divine of her to think of his comfort. The
thought of her in his arms dancing set his heart to rioting.
He was singing as he dressed, and as he rode put to Grinden
Hall, singing a specimen of the new musical insanity known
as &ldquo;jazz&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;so pestilential a music that even the fiddlers
capered and writhed.</p>
<p>The Potomac was full of tumultuous ice, and the old
Rosslyn bridge squealed with cold under the motor. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
good to see the lights of the Hall at last, and to thaw himself
out at the huge fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky to get a little wood,&rdquo; said Major Widdicombe.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;ll do when it&rsquo;s gone. Coal is next to
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the women came down, Polly and Mamise and two
or three other house guests, and some wives of important
people. They laid off their wraps and then decided to keep
them on.</p>
<p>Davidge had been so used to seeing Mamise as a plainly
clad, discouraged office-hack that when she descended the
stairs and paused on the landing a few steps from the floor,
to lift her eyebrows and her lip-corners at him, he was glad
of the pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it to me gently,&rdquo; he called across the balustrade.</p>
<p>She descended the rest of the way and advanced, revealed
in her complete height and all her radiant vesture. He was
dazed by her unimagined splendor.</p>
<p>As she gave him her hand and collected with her eyes the
tribute in his, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break what to you gently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Good Lord! Talk about &lsquo;the glory
that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With amiable reciprocity she returned him a compliment on
his evening finery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same to you and many of them. You are quite stunning
in d&eacute;collet&eacute;. For a pair of common laborers, we are
certainly gaudy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly came up and greeted Davidge with, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the
fascinating brute that keeps Marie Louise down in the penitentiary
of that awful ship-factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge indicated her brilliance and answered: &ldquo;Never
again. She&rsquo;s fired! We can&rsquo;t afford her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m an old-fashioned,
grandmotherly sort of person, but I&rsquo;ll be damned if
I can see why a woman that can look as gorgeous as Marie
Louise here should be pounding typewriter keys in an office.
Of course, if she had to&ndash;&ndash; But even then, I should say that
it would be her solemn religious duty to sell her soul for a lot
of glad-rags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of people are predicting that women will never go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
back to the foolish frills and furbelows of before the war; but&ndash;&ndash;well,
I&rsquo;m no prophetess, but all I can say is that if this
war puts an end to the dressmaker&rsquo;s art, it will certainly put
civilization on the blink. Now, honestly, what could a woman
accomplish in the world if she worked in overalls twenty-four
hours a day for twenty-four years&ndash;&ndash;what could she make that
would be more worth while than getting herself all dressed up
and looking her best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking like a French aristocrat
before the Revolution; but I wish you could convince her
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was trying to take her triumph casually, but she
was thrilled, thrilled with the supreme pride of a woman in
her best clothes&ndash;&ndash;in and out of her best clothes, and liberally
illuminated with jewelry. She was now something like a great
singer singing the highest note of her master-aria in her best
r&ocirc;le&ndash;&ndash;herself at once the perfect instrument and the perfect
artist.</p>
<p>Marie Louise went in on Davidge&rsquo;s arm. The dining-room
was in gala attire, the best silver and all of it out&ndash;&ndash;flowers
and candles. But the big vault was cold; the men shivered
and marveled at the women, who left their wraps on the
backs of their chairs and sat up in no apparent discomfort
with shoulders, backs, chests, and arms naked to the chill.</p>
<p>Polly was moved to explain to the great folk present just
who Mamise was. She celebrated Mamise in her own way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look at Miss Webling, would you take her for a perfect
nut? She is, though&ndash;&ndash;the worst ever. Do you know what
she has done? Taken up stenography and gone into the
office of a ship-building gang!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other squaws exclaimed upon her with various out-cries
of amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; said Mamise, &ldquo;I live on my salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was considered incredible in the Washington of then.
Mamise admitted that it took management.</p>
<p>Mamise said: &ldquo;Polly, can you see me living in a shanty
cooking my own breakfast and dinner and waiting on myself
and washing my own dishes? And for lunch going to a big
mess-hall, waiting on myself, too, and eating on the swollen
arm of a big chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly shook her head in despair of her. &ldquo;Let those do it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
that have to. Nobody&rsquo;s going to get me to live like a Belgian
refugee without giving me the same excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise suddenly felt that her heroism was hardly more
than a silly affectation, a patriotic pose. In these surroundings
the memory of her daily life was disgusting, plain stupidity.
Here she was in her element, at her superlative. She
breathed deeply of the atmosphere of luxury, the incense of
rich food served ceremoniously to resplendent people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to agree with you, Polly. I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;ll ever go back to honest work again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought she saw in Davidge&rsquo;s eyes a gleam of approval.
It occurred to her that he was renewing his invitation to her
to become his wife and live as a lady. She was not insulted
by the surmise.</p>
<p>When the women departed for the drawing-room, the men
sat for a while, talking of the coal famine, the appalling debts
the country was heaping into mountains&ndash;&ndash;the blood-sweating
taxes, the business end of the war, the prospect for the spring
campaign on the Western Front, the avalanche of Russia, the
rise of the Bolsheviki, the story that they were in German
pay, the terrible toll of American lives it would take to replace
the Russian armies, and the humiliating delay in getting
men into uniform, equipped, and ferried across the sea. The
astounding order had just been promulgated, shutting down
all industry and business for four days and for the ten succeeding
Mondays in order to eke out coal; this was regarded
as worse than the loss of a great battle. Every aspect of
the war was so depressing that the coroner&rsquo;s inquest broke
up at once when Major Widdicombe said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get enough of this in the shop, and I&rsquo;m frozen through.
Let&rsquo;s go in and jaw the women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concealing their loneliness, the men entered the drawing-room
with the majestic languor of lions well fed.</p>
<p>Davidge paused to study Mamise from behind a smokescreen
that concealed his stare. She was listening politely to
the wife of Holman, of the War Trade Board. Mrs. Holman&rsquo;s
stories were always long, and people were always interrupting
them because they had to or stay mute all night. Davidge
was glad of her clatter, because it gave him a chance to revel
in Mamise. She was presented to his eyes in a kind of mitigated
silhouette against a bright-hued lamp-shade. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
seated sidewise on a black Chinese chair. On the back of it
her upraised arm rested. Davidge&rsquo;s eyes followed the strange
and marvelous outline described by the lines of that arm,
running into the sharp rise of a shoulder, like an apple against
the throat, the bizarre shape of the head in its whimsical
coiffure, the slope of the other shoulder carrying the caressing
glance down that arm to the hand clasping a sheaf of outspread
plumes against her knee, and on along to where one
quaint impossible slipper with a fantastic high heel emerged
from a stream of fabric that flowed on out to the train.</p>
<p>Then with the vision of honorable desire he imagined the
body of her where it disappeared below the shoulders into the
possession of the gown; he imagined with a certain awe what
she must be like beneath all those long lines, those rounded
surfaces, those eloquent wrinkles with their curious little
pockets full of shadow, among the pools of light that satin
shimmers with.</p>
<p>In other times and climes men had worn figured silks and
satins and brocades, had worn long gowns and lace-trimmed
sleeves, jeweled bonnets and curls, but now the male had
surrendered to the female his prehistoric right to the fanciful
plumage. These war days were grown so austere that it began
to seem wrong even for women to dress with much more
than a masculine sobriety. But the occasion of this ball had
removed the ban on extravagance.</p>
<p>The occasion justified the maximum display of jewelry, too,
and Mamise wore all she had. She had taken her gems from
their prison in the safe-deposit box in the Trust Company
cellar. They seemed to be glad to be at home in the light
again. They reveled in it, winking, laughing, playing a kind
of game in which light chased light through the deeps of
color.</p>
<p>The oddity of the feminine passion for precious stones struck
Davidge sharply. The man who built iron ships to carry
freight wondered at the curious industry of those who sought
out pebbles of price, and polished them, shaped them, faceted
them, and fastened them in metals of studied design, petrified
jellies that seemed to quiver yet defied steel.</p>
<p>He contrasted the cranes that would lift a locomotive and
lower it into the hold of one of his ships with the tiny pincers
with which a lapidary picked up a diamond fleck and sealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
it in platinum. He contrasted the pneumatic riveter with
the tiny hammers of the goldsmith. There seemed to be no
less vanity about one than the other. The work of the jeweler
would outlast the iron hull. A diamond as large as a rivet-head
would cost far more than a ship. Jewels, like sonnets
and symphonies and flower-gardens, were good for nothing,
yet somehow worth more than anything useful.</p>
<p>He wondered what the future would do to these arts and
their patronesses. The one business of the world now was
the manufacture, transportation, and efficient delivery of
explosives.</p>
<p>He could understand how offensive bejeweled and banqueted
people were to the humble, who went grimy and weary in
dirty overalls over their plain clothes to their ugly factories
and back to their uglier homes.</p>
<p>It was a consummation devoutly to be wished that nobody
should spend his life or hers soiled and tired and fagged with
a monotonous task. It seemed hard that the toiling woman
and the wife and daughter of the toiler might not alleviate
their bleak persons with pearl necklaces about their throats,
with rubies pendant from their ears, and their fingers studded
with sapphire and topaz.</p>
<p>Yet it did not look possible, somehow. And it seemed
better that a few should have them rather than none at all,
better that beauty should be allowed to reign somewhere than
nowhere during its brief perfection.</p>
<p>And after all, what proof was there that the spoliation of
the rich and the ending of riches would mean the enrichment
of the poor? When panics came and the rich fasted the poor
starved. Would the reduction of the opulent and the elevation
of the paupers all to the same plain average make anybody
happier? Would the poor be glad to learn that they
could never be rich? With nobody to envy, would contentment
set in? With ambition rated as a crime, the bequeathing
of comfort to one&rsquo;s children rendered impossible, the establishment
of one&rsquo;s destiny left to the decision of boards and
by-laws, would there be satisfaction? The Bolsheviki had
voted &ldquo;universal happiness.&rdquo; It would be interesting to see
how well Russia fared during the next year and how universally
happiness might be distributed.</p>
<p>He frowned and shook his head as if to free himself from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
these nettlesome riddles and left them to the Bolshevist
Samaritans to solve in the vast laboratory where the manual
laborers at last could work out their hearts&rsquo; desires, with the
upper class destroyed and the even more hateful middle class
at their mercy.</p>
<p>It was bitter cold on the way to the ballroom in the Willard
Hotel, and Davidge in his big coat studied Mamise smothered
in a voluminous sealskin overcoat. This, too, had meant hardship
for the poor. Many men had sailed on a bitter voyage
to arctic regions and endured every privation of cold and
hunger and peril that this young woman might ride cozy in
any chill soever. The fur coat had cost much money, but
little of it had fallen into the frosted hands of the men who
clubbed the seal to death on the ice-floes. The sleek furrier
in the warm city shop, when he sold the finished garment, took
in far more than the men who went out into the wilderness
and brought back the pelts. That did not seem right; yet
he had a heavy rent to pay, and if he did not create the market
for the furs, the sealers would not get paid at all for their
voyage.</p>
<p>A division of the spoils that would rob no one, nor kill the
industry, was beyond Davidge&rsquo;s imagining. He comforted
himself with the thought that those loud mouths that advertised
solutions of these labor problems were fools or liars or
both; and their mouths were the tools they worked with most.</p>
<p>The important immediate thing to contemplate was the
fascinating head of Mamise, quaintly set on the shapeless bulk
of a sea-lion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>Davidge had been a good dancer once, and he had not
entirely neglected the new school of foot improvisation,
so different from the old set steps.</p>
<p>Mamise was amazed to find that the strenuous business man
had so much of the faun in his soul. He had evidently listened
to the pipes of Pan and could &ldquo;shake a sugar-heel&rdquo; with a
practised skill. There was a startling authority in the
firmness with which he gathered her in and swept her through
the kaleidoscopic throng, now dipping, now skipping, now
limping, now running.</p>
<p>He gripped the savory body of Mamise close to him and
found her to his whim, foreseeing it with a mysterious prescience.
Holding her thus intimately in the brief wedlock
of the dance, he began to love her in a way that he could
think of only one word for&ndash;&ndash;<i>terrible</i>.</p>
<p>She seemed to grow afraid, too, of the spell that was befogging
them, and sought rescue in a flippancy. There was
also a flattering spice of jealousy in what she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t spent all your afternoons and evenings
building ships, young man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cabarets have you graduated from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He quoted her own words, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is certain. I&rsquo;ve never found in any of &rsquo;em as
light a feather as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you referring to my head or my feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your blessed feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arm about her tightened to a suffocation, and he
whirled her in a delirium of motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfair!&rdquo; she protested, affrighted yet delighted by
the fire of his ecstasy in their union. The music stopped, and
she clung to him dizzily while he applauded with the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
dancers till the band renewed the tune. She had regained her
mental with her bodily equilibrium, and she danced more
staidly; yet she had seen into the crater of his heart and was
not sorry that it existed.</p>
<p>The reprise of the dance was brief, and he had to surrender
her from his embrace. He was unwontedly rhapsodic. &ldquo;I
wish we could sail on and on and on forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forever is a long time,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have the next dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! Take Polly round and pay for your supper.
But don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly was taken for the next dance, and he was glad of
it, but he suffered at seeing how perfectly Mamise footed it
with a young officer who also knew how to compel her to his
whim. Davidge wondered if Mamise could be responding to
this fellow as keenly as she responded to himself. The thought
was intolerable. She could not be so wanton. It would
amount to a hideous infidelity. Moorish jealousy smoldered
in his heart, and he cursed public dancing as an infamous, an
unbelievable promiscuity. Yet when he had Polly Widdicombe
for the next dance, her husband had no cause for
jealousy. Polly was a temperate dancer, all gaiety, estheticism
plus athleticism.</p>
<p>Davidge kept twisting his head about to see how Mamise
comported herself. He was being swiftly wrung to that
desperate condition in which men are made ready to commit
monogamy. He felt that he could not endure to have Mamise
free any longer.</p>
<p>He presented himself to her for the next dance.</p>
<p>She laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m booked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blanched at the treacherous heartlessness and sat the
dance out&ndash;&ndash;stood it out, rather, among the superfluous men
on the side-lines. A morose and ridiculous gloom possessed
him at seeing still a fourth stranger with his arms about
Mamise, her breast to his and her procedure obedient to his.
Worse yet, when a fifth insolent stranger cut in on the twin
stars, Mamise abandoned her fourth temporary husband for
another with a levity that amounted to outrageous polyandry.</p>
<p>Davidge felt no impulse to cut in. He disliked dancing so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
intensely that he wanted to put an end to the abomination,
reform it altogether. He did not want to dance between those
white arms so easily forsworn. He wanted to rescue Mamise
from this place of horror and hale her away to a cave with no
outlook on mankind.</p>
<p>It was she who sought him where he glowered. Perhaps she
understood him. If she did, she was wise enough to enjoy the
proof of her sway over him and still sane enough to take a joy
in her triumph.</p>
<p>She introduced her partner&ndash;&ndash;Davidge would almost have
called the brute a paramour. He did not get the man&rsquo;s name
and was glad of it&ndash;&ndash;especially as the hunter deserted her and
went after his next Sabine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost your faithful stenographer,&rdquo; was the first
phrase of Mamise&rsquo;s that Davidge understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because this is the life for me. I&rsquo;ve been a heroine and
a war-worker about as long as I can. I&rsquo;m for the fleshpots and
the cold-cream jars and the light fantastic. Aren&rsquo;t you going
to dance with me any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; Davidge said, with a singularly boyish
sulkiness, and wondered why Mamise laughed so mercilessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music struck up an abandoned jig, but he danced with
great dignity till his feet ran away with him. Then he made
off with her again in one of his frenzies, and a laughter filled
his whole being.</p>
<p>She heard him growl something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Damn you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed so heartily at this that she had to stop dancing
for a moment. She astonished him by a brazen question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really love me as much as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More,&rdquo; he groaned, and they bobbed and ducked and
skipped as he muttered a wild anachronism:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t marry me I&rsquo;ll murder you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re murdering me now. May I breathe, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was furious at her evasion of so solemn a proposal.
Yet she was so beautifully alive and aglow that he could not
exactly hate her. But he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t ask you again. Next time you can ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All right; that&rsquo;s a bet. I&rsquo;ll give you fair warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then that dance was over, and Mamise triumphant in
all things. She was tumultuously hale and happy, and her
lover loved her.</p>
<p>To her that hath&ndash;&ndash;for now, whom should Mamise see but
Lady Clifton-Wyatt? Her heart ached with a reminiscent fear
for a moment; then a malicious hope set it going again.
Major Widdicombe claimed Mamise for the next dance, and
extracted her from Davidge&rsquo;s possession. As they danced
out, leaving Davidge stranded, Mamise noted that Lady
C.-W. was regarding Davidge with a startled interest.</p>
<p>The whirl of the dance carried her close to Lady Clifton-Wyatt,
and she knew that Lady C.-W. had seen her. Broken
glimpses revealed to her that Lady C.-W. was escorting her
escort across the ballroom floor toward Davidge.</p>
<p>She saw the brazen creature tap Davidge&rsquo;s elbow and
smile, putting out her hand with coquetry. She saw her
debarrass herself of her companion, a French officer whose
exquisite horizon-blue uniform was amazingly crossed with the
wound and service chevrons of three years&rsquo; warfaring. Nevertheless,
Lady Clifton-Wyatt dropped him for the civilian
Davidge. Mamise, flitting here and there, saw that Davidge
was being led to the punch-altar, thence to a lonely strip of
chairs, where Lady C.-W. sat herself down and motioned
him to drop anchor alongside.</p>
<p>Mamise longed to be near enough to hear what she could
guess: her enemy&rsquo;s artless prelude followed by gradual modulations
to her main theme&ndash;&ndash;Mamise&rsquo;s wicked record.</p>
<p>Mamise wished that she had studied lip-reading to get the
details. But this was a slight vexation in the exultance of her
mood. She was serene in the consciousness that Davidge
already knew the facts about her, and that Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s
gossip would fall with the dreary thud of a story
heard before. So Mamise&rsquo;s feet flew, and her heart made a
music of its own to the tune of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God, I told him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She realized, as never before, the tremendous comfort and
convenience of the truth. She had been by instinct as veracious
as a politely bred person may be, but now she understood
that the truth is mighty good business. She resolved
to deal in no other wares.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>This resolution lasted just long enough for her to make a
hasty exception: she would begin her exclusive use of the
truth as soon as she had told Polly a neat lie in explanation
of her inexplicable journey to Baltimore.</p>
<p>Lady C.-W. was doing Mamise the best turn in her power.
Davidge was still angry at Mamise&rsquo;s flippancy in the face of
his ardor. But Lady C.-W.&rsquo;s attack gave the flirt the dignity
of martyrdom. When Lady C.-W. finished her subtly casual
account of all that Mamise had done or been accused of doing,
Davidge crushed her with the quiet remark:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told you that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and explained it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would!&rdquo; was the best that Lady Clifton-Wyatt could
do, but she saw that the case was lost. She saw that Davidge&rsquo;s
gaze was following Mamise here and there amid the dancers,
and she was sportswoman enough to concede:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a beauty, anyway&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s no questioning that, at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the canniest thing she could have done to re-establish
herself in Davidge&rsquo;s eyes. He felt so well reconciled with the
world that he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t care to finish this dance, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clifton-Wyatt was democratic&ndash;&ndash;in the provinces and
the States&ndash;&ndash;and this was as good a way of changing the subject
as any. She rose promptly and entered the bosom of
Davidge. The good American who did not believe in aristocracies
had just time to be overawed at finding himself
hugging a real Lady with a capital L when the music stopped.</p>
<p>It is an old saw that what is too foolish to be said can be
sung. Music hallows or denatures whatever it touches. It
was quite proper, because quite customary, for Davidge and
Lady Clifton-Wyatt to stand enfolded in each other&rsquo;s embrace
so long as a dance tune was in the air. The moment
the musicians quit work the attitude became indecent.</p>
<p>Amazing and eternal mystery, that custom can make the
same thing mean everything, or nothing, or all the between-things.
The ancient Babylonians carried the idea of the permissible
embrace to the ultimate intimacy in their annual
festivals, and the good women doubtless thought no more of it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
than a woman of to-day thinks of waltzing with a presentable
stranger. They went home to their husbands and their housework
as if they had been to church. Certain Bolsheviki,
even in the year 1918, put up placards renewing the ancient
Mesopotamian custom, under the guise of a community
privilege and a civic duty.</p>
<p>And yet some people pretend to differentiate between
fashions and morals!</p>
<p>But nobody at this dance was foolish enough to philosophize.
Everybody was out for a good time, and a Scotsman from
the British embassy came up to claim Lady Clifton-Wyatt&rsquo;s
hand and body for the next dance. Davidge had been mystically
attuned anew to Mamise, and he found her in a mood
for reconciliation. She liked him so well that when the
Italian aviator to whom she had pledged the &ldquo;Tickle Toe&rdquo;
came to demand it, she perjured herself calmly and eloped
with Davidge. And Davidge, instead of being alarmed by
her easy morals, was completely reassured.</p>
<p>But he found her unready with another perjury when he
abruptly asked her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; she temporized in a flutter, thinking of
Baltimore and Nicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve nothing special on, how about a tea-dance?
I&rsquo;m getting addicted to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m booked up for to-morrow,&rdquo; she faltered.
&ldquo;Polly keeps the calendar. Yes, I know we have some stupid
date&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t think just what. How about the day after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deferment made his amorous heart sick, and to-morrow&rsquo;s
to-morrow seemed as remote as Judgment Day. Besides,
as he explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go back to the shipyard to-morrow evening.
Couldn&rsquo;t you give me a lunch&ndash;&ndash;an early one at twelve-thirty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I could do that. In fact, I&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this delicious moment an insolent cub in boots and spurs
cut in and would not be denied. Davidge was tempted to
use his fists, but Mamise, though she longed to tarry with
Davidge, knew the value of tantalism, and consented to the
abduction. For revenge Davidge took up with Polly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
danced after Mamise, to be near her. He followed so close
that the disastrous cub, in a sudden pirouette, contrived to
swipe Polly across the shin and ankle-bones with his spur.</p>
<p>She almost swooned of agony, and clung to Davidge for
support, mixing astonishing profanity with her smothered
groans. The cub showered apologies on her, and reviled
&ldquo;Regulations&rdquo; which compelled him to wear spurs with his
boots, though he had only a desk job.</p>
<p>Polly smiled at him murderously, and said it was nothing.
But Mamise saw her distress, rid herself of the hapless criminal
and gave Polly her arm, as she limped through the barrage of
hurtling couples. Polly asked Davidge to retrieve her husband
from the sloe-eyed ambassadress who was hypnotizing
him. She wailed to Mamise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m marked for life. I ought to have a wound-chevron
for this. I&rsquo;ve got to go home and put my ankle in
splints. I&rsquo;ll probably have to wear it in a sling for a month.
I&rsquo;d like to kill the rotten hound that put me out of business.
And I had the next dance with that beautiful Rumanian
devil! You stay and dance with your ship-builder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise could not even think of it, and insisted on bidding
good night to the crestfallen Davidge. He offered to ride
out home with her, but Polly refused. She wanted to have a
good cry in the car.</p>
<p>Davidge bade Mamise good night, reminded her that she
was plighted to luncheon at twelve-thirty, and went to the
house of the friend he was stopping with, the hotels being
booked solid for weeks ahead. He was nursing a stern determination
to endure bachelordom no longer.</p>
<p>Mamise was thinking of Davidge tenderly with one of her
brains, while another segment condoled with Polly. But
most of her wits were engaged in hunting a good excuse for
her Baltimore escapade the next afternoon, and in discarding
such implausible excuses as occurred to her.</p>
<p>Bitter chill it was, and these owls, for all their feathers, were
a-cold. Major Widdicombe was chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I danced myself into a sweat, and now my undershirt is
all icicles. I know I&rsquo;ll die of pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shifted his foot, and one of his spurs grazed the ankle
of Polly, who was snuggling to him for warmth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>She yowled: &ldquo;My Gawd! My yankle! You&rsquo;ll not last
long enough for pneumonia if you touch me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was filled with remorse, but when he tried to reach
round to embrace her, she would none of him.</p>
<p>When they got to the bridge, they were amazed at the lazy
old Potomac. It was a white torment of broken ice, roaring
and slashing and battering the piers of the ancient bridge ominously,
huge sheets clambering up and falling back split and
broken, with the uproar of an attack on a walled town.</p>
<p>The chauffeur went to full speed, and the frosty boards
shrilled under the flight.</p>
<p>The house was cold when they reached it, and Mamise&rsquo;s
room was like a storage-vault. She tore off her light dancing-dress
and shivered as she stripped and took refuge in a cobwebby
nightgown. She threw on a heavy bathrobe and kept
it on when she crept into the icy interstice between the all-too-snowy
sheets.</p>
<p>She had forgotten to explain to Polly about her Baltimore
venture, and she shivered so vigorously that sleep was impossible
to her palsied bones. She grew no warmer from
besetting visions of the battle-front. She tried to shame
herself out of her chill by contrasting her opulent bed with
the dreadful dugouts in France, the observation posts, the
shell-riddled ruins, where millions somehow existed. Again,
as at Valley Forge, American soldiers were marching there in
the snow barefooted, or in rags or in wooden sabots, for lack
of ships to get new shoes across.</p>
<p>Yet, in these frozen hells there were not men enough. The
German offensive must not find the lines so sparsely defended.
Men must be combed out of every cranny of the nations and
herded to the slaughter. America was denying herself warmth
in order to build shells and to shuttle the ships back and forth.
There was need of more women, too&ndash;&ndash;thousands more to nurse
the men, to run the canteens, to mend the clothes, to warm
men&rsquo;s hearts <i>via</i> their stomachs, and to take their minds off
the madness of war a little while. The Salvation Army would
furnish them hot doughnuts in the trenches and heat up their
courage. Actors and actresses were playing at all the big
cantonments now. Later they would be going across to play
in France&ndash;&ndash;one-night stands, two a day in Picardy.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mamise felt the need to go abroad. In a kind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
burlesque of the calling of the infant Samuel, she sat up in
her bed, startled as by a voice calling her to a mission. She
had been an actress, a wanderer, a performer in cheap theaters,
a catcher of late trains, a dweller in rickety hotels. She
knew cold, and she had played half clad in draughty halls.</p>
<p>She had escaped from the life and had tried to escape the
memory of it. But now that she was so cold she felt that
nothing was so pitiful as to be cold. She understood, with a
congealing vividness, how those poor droves of lads in bitterer
cold were suffering, scattered along the frontiers of war like
infinite flocks of sheep caught in a blizzard. She felt ashamed
to be here shivering in this palatial misery when she might
be sharing the all-but-unbearable squalor of the soldiers.</p>
<p>The more she recoiled from the hardships the more she
felt the impulse. It would be her atonement.</p>
<p>She would buy a trombone and retire into the wilderness
to practise it. She would lay her dignity, her aristocracy, her
pride, on the altar of sacrifice, and go among the despondent
soldiers as a Sister of Gaiety. Perhaps Bill the Blackfaceman
would be going over&ndash;&ndash;if he had not stayed in Germany
too long and been interned there. To return to the team with
him, being the final degradation, would be the final atonement.
She felt that she was called, called back. There could
be nothing else she would hate more to do; therefore she would
love to do that most of all.</p>
<p>She would lunch with Davidge to-morrow, tell him her
plan, bid him farewell, go to Baltimore, learn Nicky&rsquo;s secret,
thwart it one way or another&ndash;&ndash;and then set about her destiny.</p>
<p>She abhorred the relapse so utterly that she wept. The
warm tears refreshed her eyes before they froze on her cheeks,
and she fell asleep in the blissful assurance of a martyrdom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>The next morning Mamise woke in her self-warmed bed,
at the nudge of a colored maid bundled up like an Eskimo,
who carried a breakfast-tray in mittened hands.</p>
<p>Mamise said: &ldquo;Oh, good morning, Martha. I&rsquo;ll bathe
before breakfast if you&rsquo;ll turn on the hot water, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot water? Humph! Pipes done froze last night, an&rsquo;
bus&rsquo; loose this mo&rsquo;nin&rsquo;, and fill the kitchen range with water
an&rsquo; bus&rsquo; loose again. No plumber here yit. Made this
breakfuss on the gas-stove. That&rsquo;s half-froze, tew. I tell
you, ma&rsquo;am, you&rsquo;re lucky to git your coffee nohow. Better
take it before it freezes, tew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise sighed and glanced at the clock. The reproachful
hands stood at eleven-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the clock freeze, too? That can&rsquo;t be the right
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum, that&rsquo;s the raht tahm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise sat up, drew the comforters about her back, and
breakfasted with speed. She dressed with all the agility she
could muster.</p>
<p>She regretted the bath. She missed it, and so must we all.
In modern history, as in modern fiction, it is not nice in the
least for the heroine&ndash;&ndash;even such a dubious heroine as Mamise&ndash;&ndash;to
have a bathless day. As for heroes, in the polite chronicles
they get at least two baths a day: one heroic cold shower in
the morning and one hot tub in the late afternoon before
getting into the faultless evening attire. This does not apply
to heroes of Russian masterpieces, of course, for they never
bathe. (&ldquo;Why should they,&rdquo; my wife puts in, &ldquo;since they&rsquo;re
going to commit suicide, anyway?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>But the horrors of the Great War included this atrocity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
that the very politest people came to know the old-fashioned
luxury of an extra-dry life. There was a time when cleanliness
was accounted as ungodliness and the Christian saints anathematized
the bath as an Oriental pollution. During our war
of wars there was a vast amount of helpless holy living.</p>
<p>Exquisite gentlemen kept to their clothes for weeks at a
time and grew rancid and lousy among the rats that were
foul enough to share their stinking dens with them. If these
gentlemen were wounded, perchance, they added stale blood,
putrefaction, and offal to their abominable fetor.</p>
<p>And women who had been pretty and soapy and without
smell, and who had once blanched with shame at the least
maculation, lived with these slovenly men and vermin and
dead horses and old dead soldiers and shared their glorious
loathsomeness.</p>
<p>The world acquired a strong stomach, and Mamise&rsquo;s one
skip-bath day must be endured. If the indecency ever occurred
again it will be left unmentioned. Heaven knows
that even this morning she looked pure enough when she was
dressed.</p>
<p>Mamise found that Polly was still in bed, giving her damaged
ankle as an excuse. She stuck it out for Mamise&rsquo;s inspection,
and Mamise pretended to be appalled at the bruise she could
almost see.</p>
<p>Mamise remembered her plan to go abroad and entertain
the soldiers. Polly tried to dissuade her from an even crazier
scheme than ship-building, but ended by promising to telephone
her husband to look into the matter of a passport for her.</p>
<p>Despite her best efforts, it was already twelve-thirty and
Mamise had not left the house. She was afraid that Davidge
would be miffed. Polly suggested telephoning the hotel.</p>
<p>Those were bad days for telephoners. The wires were as
crowded as everything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take an hour to get the hotel,&rdquo; said Mamise,
&ldquo;another hour to page the man. I&rsquo;ll make a dash for it.
He&rsquo;ll give me a little grace, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car was not ready when she got to the door. The
engine was balky and bucky with the cold, and the chauffeur
in a like mood. The roads were sleety and skiddy, and
required careful driving.</p>
<p>Best of all, when she reached the bridge at last, she found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
it closed to traffic. The Potomac had been infected by the war
spirit. In sheer Hunnishness it had ravaged its banks, shearing
away boat-houses and piers, and carrying all manner of
wreckage down to pound the old aqueduct bridge with.
The bridge was not expected to live.</p>
<p>It did, but it was not intrusted with traffic till long after the
distraught Mamise had been told that the only way to get
to Washington was by the Highway Bridge from Alexandria,
and this meant a d&eacute;tour of miles. It gave Mamise her first
and only grand rounds through Fort Myer and the Arlington
National Cemetery. She felt sorry for the soldiers about the
cold barracks, but she was in no mood to respond to the
marble pages of the Arlington epic.</p>
<p>The night before she had beheld in a clear vision the living
hosts in Flanders and France, but here under the snow lay
sixteen thousand dead, two thousand a hundred and eleven
heroes under one monument of eternal anonymity&ndash;&ndash;dead
from all our wars, and many of them with their wives and
daughters privileged to lie beside them.</p>
<p>But the mood is everything, and Mamise was too fretful
to rise to this occasion; and when her car had crept the
uneasy miles and reached the Alexandria bridge and crossed
it, and wound through Potomac Park, past the Washington
Monument standing like a stupendous icicle, and reached
the hotel, she was just one hour late.</p>
<p>Davidge had given her up in disgust and despair, after
vain efforts to reach her at various other possible luncheon-places.
He searched them all on the chance that she might
have misunderstood the rendezvous. And Mamise spent a
frantic hour trying to find him at some hotel. He had
registered nowhere, since a friend had put him up. The sole
result of this interesting game of two needles hunting each
other through a haystack was that Davidge went without
lunch and Mamise ate alone.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon Davidge made another try. He finally
got Polly Widdicombe on the telephone and asked for Mamise.
Polly expressed her amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she just telephoned that she was staying in town to
dine with you and go to the theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the befuddled Davidge. &ldquo;Oh, of course! Silly
of me! Good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>Now he was indeed in a mental mess. Besides, he had
another engagement to dinner. He spent a long, exasperating
hour in a telephone-chase after his host, told a poor lie to
explain the necessity for breaking the engagement, and spent
the rest of the evening hunting Mamise in vain.</p>
<p>When he took the train for his shipyard at last he was in a
hopeless confusion between rage at Mamise and fear that some
mishap had befallen her. It would have been hard to tell
whether he loved her or hated her the more.</p>
<p>But she, after giving up the pursuit of him, had taken up
an inquiry into the trains to Baltimore. The time was now too
short for her to risk a journey out to Grinden Hall and back
for a suit-case, in view of the Alexandria d&eacute;tour. She must,
therefore, travel without baggage. Therefore she must return
the same night. She found, to her immense relief, that this
could be done. The seven-o&rsquo;clock train to Baltimore reached
there at eight, and there was a ten-ten train back.</p>
<p>She had not yet devised a lie to appease Polly with, but
now an inspiration came to her. She had told Davidge that
she was dining out with Polly somewhere; consequently it
would be safe to tell Polly that she was dining out with
Davidge somewhere. The two would never meet to compare
notes. Besides, it is pleasanter to lie by telephone. One
cannot be seen to blush.</p>
<p>She called up Grinden Hall and was luckily answered by
what Widdicombe called &ldquo;the ebony maid with the ivory
head.&rdquo; Mamise told her not to summon her lame mistress
to the telephone, but merely to say that Miss Webling was
dining with Mr. Davidge and going to the theater with him.
She made the maid repeat this till she had it by heart, then
rang off.</p>
<p>This was the message that Polly received and later transmitted
to Davidge for his bewilderment.</p>
<p>To fill the hours that must elapse before her train could
leave, Mamise went to one of those moving-picture shows
that keep going without interruption. Public benefactors
maintain them for the salvation of women who have no homes
or do not want to go to them yet.</p>
<p>The moving-picture service included the usual news weekly,
as usual leading one to marvel why the stupid subjects
shown were selected from all the fascinating events of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
time. Then followed a doleful imitation of Mr. Charles
Chaplin, which proved by its very fiasco the artistry of the
original.</p>
<p>The <i>cinema de r&eacute;sistance</i> was a long and idiotic vampire
picture in which a stodgy creature lured impossible males to
impossible ruin by wiles and attitudes that would have driven
any actual male to flight, laughter, or a call for the police.
But the audience seemed to enjoy it, as a substitute, no doubt,
for the old-fashioned gruesome fairy-stories that one accepts
because they are so unlike the tiresome realities. Mamise
wondered if vampirism really succeeded in life. She was
tempted to try a little of it some time, just as an experiment,
if ever opportunity offered.</p>
<p>In any case, the picture served its main purpose. It whiled
away the dull afternoon till the dinner hour. She took her
dinner on the train, remembering vividly how her heart
history with Davidge had begun on a train. She missed him
now, and his self-effacing gallantry.</p>
<p>The man opposite her wanted to be cordial, but his motive
was ill concealed, and Mamise treated him as if he didn&rsquo;t
quite exist. Suddenly she remembered with a gasp that she
had never paid Davidge for that chair he gave up to her.
She vowed again that she would not forget. She felt a deep
remorse, too, for a day of lies and tricks. She regretted
especially the necessity of deceiving Davidge. It was her
privilege to hoodwink Polly and other people, but she had no
right to deceive Davidge. She was beginning to feel that she
belonged to him.</p>
<p>She resolved to atone for these new transgressions, too,
as well as her old, by getting over to France as soon as possible
and subjecting herself to a self-immolation among hardships.
After the war&ndash;&ndash;assuming that the war would soon end
and that she would come out of it alive&ndash;&ndash;afterward she
could settle down and perhaps marry Davidge.</p>
<p>Reveling in these pleasantly miserable schemes, she was
startled to find Baltimore already gathering round the train.
And she had not even begun to organize her stratagems
against Nicky Easton. She made a hasty exit from the car
and sought the cab-ranks outside.</p>
<p>From the shadows a shadowy man semi-detached himself,
lifted his hat, and motioned her to an open door. She bent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
her head down and her knees up and entered a little room
on wheels.</p>
<p>Nicky had evidently given the chauffeur instructions, for
as soon as Nicky had come in, doubled up, and seated himself
the limousine moved off&ndash;&ndash;into what adventures? Mamise
was wondering.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Mamise remembered her earlier visits to Baltimore as a
tawdry young vaudevillette. She had probably walked
from the station, lugging her own valise, to some ghastly
theatrical boarding-house. Perhaps some lover of hers had
carried her baggage for her. If so, she had forgotten just
which one of her experiences he was.</p>
<p>Now she hoped to be even more obscure and unconsidered
than she had been then, when a little attention was meat
and drink, and her name in the paper was a sensation. She
knew that publicity, like love, flees whoso pursueth and pursues
who flees it, but she prayed that the rule would be proved
by an exception to-night, and that she might sneak out as
anonymously as she had sneaked in.</p>
<p>Nicky Easton was a more immediate problem. He was
groping for her hands. When he found them she was glad
that she had her gloves on. They were chaperoned, too, as
it were, by their heavy wraps. She was fairly lost in her furs
and he in a burly overcoat, so that when in a kind of frenzy
he thrust one cumbrous arm about her the insulation was
complete. He might as well have been embracing the cab
she was in.</p>
<p>But the insolence of the intention enraged her, and she
struggled against him as a she-bear might rebuff a too familiar
bruin&ndash;&ndash;buffeted his arms away and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imbecile! Do you want me to knock on the glass
and tell the driver to let me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Nein doch</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me alone or I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky sighed abysmally and sank back. He said nothing
at all to her, and she said the same to him while long strips
of Baltimorean marble stoops went by. They turned into
Charles Street and climbed past its statue-haunted gardens
and on out to the north.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>They were almost at Druid Hill Park before Mamise realized
that she was wasting her time and her trip for nothing. She
spoke angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you wanted to see me. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky fidgeted and sulked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not neet to told you now. You have such a hatink
from me, it is no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had told me you simply wanted to spoon with
me I could have stayed at home. You said you wanted to
ask me something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my enswer. It is not any neet to esk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was puzzled; her wrath was yielding to curiosity.
But she could not imagine how to coax him out of silence.</p>
<p>His disappointment coaxed him. He groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ach Gott</i>, I am so lunly. My own people doand trust me.
These Yenkees also not. I get no chence to proof how I loaf
my <i>Vaterland</i>. But the time comes soon, and I must make
patience. <i>Eile mit Weile!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell me what&rsquo;s on your mind,&rdquo; Mamise suggested,
but he shook his head. The car rolled into the gloom
of the park, a gloom rather punctuated than diminished by
the street-lamps. Mamise realized that she could not extort
Nicky&rsquo;s secret from him by asserting her own dignity.</p>
<p>She wondered how to persuade him, and found no ideas
except such silly schemes as were suggested by her memory
of the vampire picture. She hated the very passage of such
thoughts through her mind, but they kept returning, with
an insistent idea that a patriotic vampire might accomplish
something for her country as Delilah and Judith had &ldquo;vamped&rdquo;
for theirs. She had never seen a vampire exercise her fascinations
in a fur coat in a dark automobile, but perhaps the dark
was all the better for her purpose.</p>
<p>At any rate, she took the dare her wits presented her, and
after a struggle with her own mutinous muscles she put out
her hand and sought Nicky&rsquo;s, as she cooed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Nicky, don&rsquo;t be so cantankerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand registered the surprise he felt in the fervor of its
clutch:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are so colt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She insinuated, &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t expect me to make love to
you the very first thing, could you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you do like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands wringing his told the lie her tongue refused. And
he, encouraged and determined to prove his rating with her,
flung his arm about her again and drew her, resisting only
in her soul, close to him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>But when his lips hunted hers she hid them in her fur collar;
and he, imputing it to coquetry, humored her, finding her
delicate timidity enhancing and inspiring. He chuckled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall kiss me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till you have told me what you sent for me for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, feerst you must give me one to proof your good fate&ndash;&ndash;your
good face&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He was trying to say &ldquo;good faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was stubborn, but he was more obstinate still, and he
had the advantage of the secret.</p>
<p>And so at last she sighed &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; and put up her cheek
to pay the price. His arms tightened about her, and his lips
were not content with her cheek. He fought to win her lips,
but she began to tear off her gloves to scratch his eyes out
if need be for release.</p>
<p>She was revolted, and she would have marred his beauty if
he had not let her go. Once freed, she regained her self-control,
for the sake of her mission, and said, with a mock
seriousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, be careful, or I won&rsquo;t listen to you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sighing with disappointment, but more determined than
ever to make her his, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feerst I must esk you, how is your feelink about Chermany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chust as vich &lsquo;before&rsquo;? Do you loaf Chermany or
hate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was permitted to say only one thing. It came hard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ach, beh&uuml;t&rsquo; dich, Gott!</i>&rdquo; he cried, and would have clasped
her again, but she insisted on discipline. He began his
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did told you how, to safe my life in England, I confessed
somethings. Many of our people here will not forgive. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
only vay to get back vere I have been is to make&ndash;&ndash;as Americans
say&ndash;&ndash;to make myself skvare by to do some big vork. I have
done a little, not much, but more can be if you help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much things, but the greatest&ndash;&ndash;listen once: our Chermany
has no fear of America so long America is on this side of
the Atlentic Ozean. Americans build ships; Chermany must
destroy fester as they build. Already I have made one ship
less for America. I cannot pooblish advertisink, but my
people shall one day know, and that day comes soon; <i>Der
Tag</i> is almost here&ndash;&ndash;you shall see! Our army grows alvays,
in France; and England and France can get no more men.
Ven all is ready, Chermany moves like a&ndash;&ndash;a avalenche down
a mountain and covers France to the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that day our fleet&ndash;&ndash;our glorious ships&ndash;&ndash;comes out
from Kiel Canal, vere man holds them beck like big dogs in
leash. Oh those beautiful day, Chermany conquers on lent
and on sea. France dies, and England&rsquo;s navy goes down into
the deep and comes never back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ach Gott</i>, such a day it shall be&ndash;&ndash;when old England&rsquo;s empire
goes into history, into ancient history vit Roossia and
Rome and Greece and Bebylonia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;England gone, France gone, Italy gone&ndash;&ndash;who shall safe
America and her armies and her unborn ships, and her cannon
and shell and air-ships not yet so much as begun?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Der Tag</i> shall be like the lest day ven <i>Gott</i> makes the
graves open and the dead come beck to life. The Americans
shall fall on knees before our Kaiser, and he shall render
chudgment. Such a payink!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the Yenkees despise us Chermans. Ve cannot go to
this city, to that dock. Everywhere is dead-lines and permissions
and internment camps and persecutions, and all
who are not in prison are afraid. They change their names
from Cherman to English now, but soon they shall lift their
heads and it shall be the Americans who shall know the dead-lines,
the licenses, the internment camps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Marie Louise, my sveetheart, if you can show and I
can show that in the dark night ve did not forget the <i>Vaterland</i>,
ve shall be proud and safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to make you safe ven comes <i>Der Tag</i> I speak to
you now. I vish you should share my vork now, so you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
can share my life efterwards. Now do I loaf you, Marie
Louise? Now do I give you proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was all ashudder with the intensity of his conviction.
She imagined an all-conquering Germany in America.
She needed but to multiply the story of Belgium, of
Serbia, of prostrate Russia. The Kaiser had put in the shop-window
of the world samples enough of the future as it would
be made by Germany.</p>
<p>And in the mood of that day, with defeatism rife in Europe,
and pessimism miasmatic in America, there was reason
enough for Nicky to believe in his prophecy and to inspire
belief in its possibility. The only impossible thing about it
was that the world should ever endure the dominance of
Germany. Death would seem better to almost everybody
than life in such a civilization as she promised.</p>
<p>Mamise feared the Teutonic might, but she could not for a
moment consent to accept it. There was only one thing for
her to do, and that was to learn what plans she could, and
thwart them. Here within her grasp was the long-sought
opportunity to pay off the debt she had incurred. She could
be a soldier now, at last. There was no price that Nicky might
have demanded too great, too costly, too shameful for her to
pay. To denounce him or defy him would be a criminal waste
of opportunity.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;I understand. You are right, of course. Let
me help in any way I can. I only wish there were something
big for me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky was overjoyed. He had triumphed both as patriot
and as lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a big think for you to do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can
all you vill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in shipyard. This man Davidge goes on building
ships. I gave him fair warning. I sinked one ship for him,
but he makes more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sank his ship?&rdquo; Mamise gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! The <i>Clara</i>, he called her. I find where she goes to
take cargo. I go myself. I row up behind the ship in little
boat, and I fasten by the rudder-post under the water, where no
one sees, a bomb. It is all innocent till ship moves. Then every
time the rudder turns a little screw turns in the machine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It turns for two, three days; then&ndash;&ndash;<i>boom</i>! It makes explosion,
tears ship to pieces, and down she goes. And so
goes all the next ships if you help again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again? What do you mean by again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you, Marie Louise, who sinks the <i>Clara</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her laugh of incredulity was hardly more than a shiver
of dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ja wohl!</i> You did told Chake Nuttle vat Davidge tells
you. Chake Nuttle tells me. I go and make sink the ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake Nuddle! It was Jake that told you!&rdquo; Mamise faltered,
seeing her first vague suspicions damnably confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Chake Nuttle is my <i>Leutnant</i>. He has had much
money. He gets more. He shall be rich man after comes
<i>Der Tag</i>. It might be we make him von Nuttle! and you shall
be Gr&auml;fin von Oesten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was in an abject terror. The thick trees of the
park were spooky as the dim light of the car elicited from
the black wall of dark faint details of tree-trunks and naked
boughs stark with winter. She was in a hurry to learn the
rest and be gone. She spoke with a poor imitation of pride:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have already done something more for Germany.
That&rsquo;s splendid. Now tell me what else I can do, for I want
to&ndash;&ndash;to get busy right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicky was too intoxicated with his success to see through
her thin disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are close by Davidge. Chake Nuttle tells me he is
sveet on you. You have his confidence. You can learn
what secrets he has. Next time we do not vait for ship to
be launched and to go for cargo. It might go some place
ve could not find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now ve going blow up those ships before they touch
vater&ndash;&ndash;ve blow up his whole yard. You shall go beck and
take up again your vork, and ven all is right I come down
and get a job. I dress like vorkman and get into the yard.
And I bring in enough bombs to blow up all the ships and
the cranes and the machines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chake Nuttle tells me Davidge just gets a plate-bending
machine. Forty-five t&rsquo;ousand dollars it costs him, and long
time to get. In one minute&ndash;&ndash;poof! Ve bend that plate-bender!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a great Teutonic laugh and supposed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
she was laughing, too. When he had subsided a little,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now you know vat you are to make! You like to
do so much for Chermany, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes! Yes!&rdquo; said Mamise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promise to do vat I send you vord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She would have promised to blow up the Capitol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ach</i>, how beautiful you are even in the dark! Kiss me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering Judith, she paid that odious price, wishing
that she might have the beast&rsquo;s infamous head with a sword.
It was a kiss of betrayal, but she felt that it was no Judas-kiss,
since Nicky was no Christ.</p>
<p>He told her more of his plans in detail, and was so childishly
proud of his superb achievements, past and future, that she
could hardly persuade him to take her back to the station.
He assured her that there was abundant time, but she would
not trust his watch. She explained how necessary it was for
her to return to Washington and to Polly Widdicombe&rsquo;s house
before midnight. And at last he yielded to her entreaties,
opened the door, and leaned out to tell the driver to turn back.</p>
<p>Mamise was uneasy till they were out of the park and into
the lighted streets again. But there was no safety here, for
as they glided down Charles Street a taxicab going with the
reckless velocity of taxicabs tried to cut across their path.</p>
<p>There was a swift fencing for the right of way, and then the
two cars came together with a clash and much crumpling of
fenders.</p>
<p>The drivers descended to wrangle over the blame, and
Mamise had visions of a trip to the police station, with a consequent
exposure. But Nicky was alive to the danger of
notoriety. He got out and assumed the blame, taking the
other driver&rsquo;s part and offering to pay the damages.</p>
<p>The taxicab-driver assessed them liberally at fifty dollars,
and Nicky filled his palm with bills, ordering his own driver
to proceed. The car limped along with a twisted steering-gear,
and Nicky growled thanksgivings over the narrow escape the
German Empire had had from losing two of its most valuable
agents.</p>
<p>Mamise was sick with terror of what might have been.
She saw the collision with a fatal result, herself and Nicky
killed and flung to the street, dead together. It was not the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
fear of dying that froze her soul; it was the posthumous blow
she would have given to Davidge&rsquo;s trust in her and all women,
the pain she would have inflicted on his love. For to his
dying day he would have believed her false to him, a cheap
and nasty trickster, sneaking off to another town to a rendezvous
with another man. And that man a German!</p>
<p>The picture of his bitter disillusionment and of her own
unmerited and eternal disgrace was intolerably real in spite
of the fact that she knew it to be untrue, for our imaginations
are far more ancient and more irresistible than our late and
faltering reliance on the truth; the heavens and hells we fancy
have more weight with our credulities than any facts we encounter.
We can dodge the facts or close our eyes to them,
but we cannot escape our dreams, whether our eyes are wide
or sealed.</p>
<p>Mamise could not free herself of this nightmare till she had
bidden Nicky good-by the last time and left him in the cab
outside the station.</p>
<p>Further nightmares awaited her, for in the waiting-room she
could not fight off the conviction that the train would never
arrive. When it came clanging in on grinding wheels and she
clambered aboard, she knew that it would be wrecked, and
the finding of her body in the d&eacute;bris, or its disappearance in
the flames, would break poor Davidge&rsquo;s heart and leave her to
the same ignominy in his memory.</p>
<p>While the train swung on toward Washington, she added another
torment to her collection: how could she save Davidge
from Nicky without betraying her sister&rsquo;s husband into the
hands of justice? What right had she to tell Davidge anything
when her sacred duty to her family and her poor sister
must first be heartlessly violated?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Mamise was astounded by the altered aspect of her own
soul, for people can on occasion accomplish what the
familiar Irish drillmaster invited his raw recruits to do&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Step
out and take a look at yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, like the old lady of the nursery rhymes whose skirts
were cut off while she slept, Mamise regarded herself with
incredulity and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can this be I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she had had a little dog at home, it would have barked
at her in unrecognition and convinced her that she was not
herself.</p>
<p>What astounded her was the realization that the problem
of disregarding either her love or her duty was no longer a
difficult problem. In London, when she had dimly suspected
her benefactors, the Weblings, of betraying the trust that England
put in them, she had abhorred the thought of mentioning
her surmise to any one who might harm them. Later,
at the shipyard, when she had suspected her sister&rsquo;s husband
of disloyalty, she had put away the thought of action because
it would involve her sister&rsquo;s ruin. But now, as she left Baltimore,
convinced that her sister&rsquo;s husband was in a plot
against her lover and her country, she felt hardly so much as
a brake on her eagerness for the sacrifice of her family or herself.
The horror had come to be a solemn duty so important
as to be almost pleasant. She was glad to have something
at last to give up for her nation.</p>
<p>The thorough change in her desires was due to a complete
change in her soul. She had gradually come to love the man
whose prosperity was threatened by her sister&rsquo;s husband, and
her vague patriotism had been stirred from dreams to delirium.
Almost the whole world was undergoing such a war change.
The altar of freedom so shining white had recently become
an altar of sacrifice splashed with the blood of its votaries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Men were offering themselves, casting from them all the old
privileges of freedom, the hopes of success in love and business,
and submitting to discipline, to tyranny, to vile hardships.
Wives and mothers were hurrying their men to the
slaughter; those who had no men to give or men too weak
for the trenches or unwilling to go were ashamed of themselves
because they were missing from the beadroll of contributors.</p>
<p>Mamise had become fanatic with the rest. She had wished
to build ships, and had been refused more than a stenographer&rsquo;s
share in the process. Next she had planned to go to the firing-line
herself and offer what gift she had&ndash;&ndash;the poor little gift of
entertaining the soldiers with the vaudeville stunts she had
lived down. And while she waited for a passport to join the
army of women in France, she found at hand an opportunity
to do a big deed, to thwart the enemy, to save ships and all
the lives that ships alone could save. The price would be the
liberty and what little good name her sister&rsquo;s husband had;
it would mean protests and tears from her poor sister, whom
life had dealt with harshly enough already.</p>
<p>But Mamise counted the cost as nothing compared to what
it would buy. She dared not laugh aloud in the crowded
chair-car, but her inner being was shaken with joy. She had
learned to love Davidge and to adore that strange, shapeless
idea that she called her country. Instead of sacrificing her
lover to her people, she could serve both by the same deed.
She was wildly impatient for the moment when she could
lay before Davidge the splendid information she had secured
at the expense of a few negligible lies. If they should cost
her a decade in purgatorial torments, she would feel that they
were worth it.</p>
<p>She reached Washington at a little after eleven and Grinden
Hall before midnight. Now as she stood on the portico
and looked across the river at the night-lit city, she felt such
a pride as she had never known.</p>
<p>She waved a salutation to the wraith of a town, her mind,
if not her lips, voicing the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You owe me something, old capital. You&rsquo;ll never put up
any statues to me or carve my name on any tablets, but I&rsquo;m
doing something for you that will mean more than anybody
will ever realize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and found the black maid gaping at her sleepily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
and wondering what invisible lover she was waving at.
Mamise made no explanation, but went in, feeling a trifle
foolish, but divinely so.</p>
<p>Polly got out of bed and came all bundled up to Mamise&rsquo;s
room to demand an accounting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just on the point of telephoning the police to see if
you had been found in the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise did not bother either to explain her past lies or tell
any new ones. She majestically answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly darling, I have been engaged in affairs of state, which
I am not at liberty to divulge to the common public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;I believe the &lsquo;affairs,&rsquo; but not the
&lsquo;state.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was above insult. &ldquo;Some day you will know.
You&rsquo;ve heard of Helen of Troy, the lady with the face that
launched a thousand ships? Well, this face of mine will
launch at least half a dozen freight-boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly yawned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call my doctor in the morning and
have you taken away quietly. Your mind&rsquo;s wandering, as
well as the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise chuckled like a child with a great secret, and Polly
waddled back to her bed.</p>
<p>Next morning Mamise woke into a world warm with her
own importance, though the thermometer was farther down
than Washington&rsquo;s oldest records. She called Davidge on the
long-distance telephone, and there was a zero in his voice that
she had never heard before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mamise,&rdquo; she sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Simply that and nothing more.</p>
<p>She laughed aloud, glad that he cared enough for her to be
so angry at her. She forgot the decencies of telephone etiquette
enough to sing out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really love me so madly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He loathed sentimentalities over the telephone, and she
knew it, and was always indulging in them. But the fat was
on the wire now, and he came back at her with a still icier
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one good excuse for what you&rsquo;ve done. Are
you telephoning from a hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, from Polly&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can&rsquo;t imagine any excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re a business man, not an imaginator,&rdquo; she railed.
&ldquo;You evidently don&rsquo;t know me. I&rsquo;m &lsquo;Belle Boyd, the Rebel
Spy,&rsquo; and also &lsquo;Joan of Arkansas,&rsquo; and a few other patriots.
I&rsquo;ve got news for you that will melt the icicles off your eyebrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; he answered, with no curiosity modifying his
anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War news. May I come down and tell you about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a free country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! You&rsquo;re simply adorable when you try to sulk.
What time would be most convenient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no more appointments with you, young woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Then I&rsquo;ll wait at my shanty till you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to rent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just dare! I am coming back to work. The strike
is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come to the office as soon as you get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Give my love to Miss Gabus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the telephone and set about packing her things in
a fury. Polly reminded her that she had appointments for
fittings at dressmakers&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never keep appointments,&rdquo; said Mamise. &ldquo;You can
cancel them for me till this cruel war is over. Have the bills
sent to me at the shipyard, will you, dear? Sorry to bother
you, but I&rsquo;ve barely time to catch my train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Polly called her a once unmentionable name that was coming
into fashionable use after a long exile. Women had draped
themselves in a certain animal&rsquo;s pelt with such freedom and
grace for so many years that its name had lost enough of its
impropriety to be spoken, and not too much to express
disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You skunk!&rdquo; said Polly. And Mamise laughed. Everything
made her laugh now; she was so happy that she began
to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the crocodiles?&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re leaving
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m crying because I didn&rsquo;t realize how unhappy I had
always been before I am as happy as I am now. I&rsquo;m going
to be useful at last, Polly. I&rsquo;m going to do something for
my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was sharing in that vast national ecstasy which is called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
patriotism and which turns the flames of martyrdom into
roses.</p>
<p>When Mamise reached the end of her journey she found
Davidge waiting for her at the railroad station with a
limousine.</p>
<p>His manner was studiously insulting, but he was helplessly
glad to see her, and the humiliation he had suffered from her
failure to keep her engagements with him in Washington was
canceled by the tribute of her return to him. The knot of his
frown was solved by the mischief of her smile. He had to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you meet me at luncheon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I prevent the Potomac from putting the old
bridge out of commission?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I got there in
time, but they wouldn&rsquo;t let me across, and by the time I
reached the hotel you had gone, and I didn&rsquo;t know where to
find you. Heaven knows I tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simplicity of this explanation deprived him of every
excuse for further wrath, and he was not inspired to ask any
further questions. He was capable of nothing better than a
large and stupid:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you hear what I&rsquo;ve got to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But first he disclosed a little plot of his own with a comfortable
guiltiness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;since you say you
have news&ndash;&ndash;how would you like&ndash;&ndash;instead of going to your
shanty&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve had a fire built in it&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;how would you
like to take a ride in the car&ndash;&ndash;out into the country, you know?
Then you could tell me, and nobody would hear or interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was startled by the similarity of his arrangement to
that of Nicky Easton, but she approached it with different
dread.</p>
<p>She regretted the broad daylight and the disconcerting
landscape. In the ride with Nicky she had been enveloped
in the dark. Now the sky was lined with unbleached wool.
The air was thick with snow withheld, and the snow on the
ground took the color of the sky. But the light was searching,
cynical, and the wayside scenes were revealed with the
despondent starkness of a Russian novel. In this romanceless,
colorless dreariness it was not easy for Mamise to gloss
over the details of her meeting with Nicky Easton.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>There was no escaping this part of the explanation, however,
and she could see how little comfort Davidge took from the
news that she had gone so far to be alone with a former
devotee. A man does not want his sweetheart to take risks
for him beyond a certain point, and he would rather not be
saved at all than be saved by her at too high a price. The
modern man has a hard time living down the heritage from the
ten-thousand-year habitude of treating his women like children
who cannot be trusted to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Mamise had such poor success with the part of her chronicle
she wished to publish that she boggled miserably the part she
wanted to handle with most discretion. As is usual in such
cases, the most conspicuous thing about her message was her
inability to conceal the fact that she was concealing something.
Davidge&rsquo;s imagination was consequently so busy that
he paid hardly any attention to the tremendous facts she so
awkwardly delivered.</p>
<p>She might as well have told him flat that Nicky would not
divulge his plot except with his arms about her and his lips
at her cheeks. That would not have been easy telling, but
it was all too easy imagining for Davidge. He was thrown
into an utter wretchedness by the vision he had of her surrender
to the opportunity and to the undoubted importunity of her
companion. He had a morbid desire to make her confess,
and confessors have a notorious appetite for details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t riding with Easton alone in the dark all that
time&ndash;&ndash;without&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited for the question as for a bludgeon. Davidge had
some trouble in wielding it. He hated the thought so much
that the words were unspeakable, and he hunted for some paraphrase.
In the sparse thesaurus of his vocabulary he found
nothing subtle. He groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without his&ndash;&ndash;his making love to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; said Mamise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to. You&rsquo;ve answered,&rdquo; Davidge snarled.
&ldquo;And so will he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise&rsquo;s heart was suddenly a live coal, throbbing with
fire and keenly painful&ndash;&ndash;yet very warm. She had a man who
loved her well enough to hate for her and to avenge her.
That was something gained.</p>
<p>Davidge brooded. It was inconceivably hideous that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
should have given his heart to this pretty thing at his side
only to have her ensconce herself in the arms of another man
and give him the liberty of her cheeks&ndash;&ndash;Heaven knew, hell
knew, what other liberties. He vowed that he would never
put his lips where another man&rsquo;s had been.</p>
<p>Mamise seemed to feel soiled and fit only for the waste-basket
of life. She had delivered her &ldquo;message to Garcia,&rdquo;
and Garcia rewarded her with disgust. She waited shame-fast
for a moment before she could even falter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you happen to hear the news I brought you? Or
doesn&rsquo;t it interest you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge answered with repugnance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her meekness she needed some insult to revive her, and
this sufficed. She flared instantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I told you. I hope that Nicky blows up your
whole damned shipyard and you with it; and I&rsquo;d like to help
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing less insane could have served the brilliant effect of
that outburst. It cleared the sultry air like a crackling thunderbolt.
A gentle rain followed down her cheeks, while the
overcharged heart of Davidge roared with Jovian laughter.</p>
<p>There is no cure for these desperate situations like such an
explosion. It burns up at once the litter of circumstance and
leaves hardly an ash. It fuses elements that otherwise resist
welding, and it annihilates all minor fears in one great terror
that ends in a joyous relief.</p>
<p>Mamise was having a noble cry now, and Davidge was sobbing
with laughter&ndash;&ndash;the two forms of recreation most congenial
to their respective sexes.</p>
<p>Davidge caught her hands and cooed with such noise that
the driver outside must have heard the reverberations through
the glass:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blessed child! I&rsquo;m a low-lived brute, and you&rsquo;re an
angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man loves to call himself a brute, and a woman loves to
be called an angel, especially when it is untrue in both cases.</p>
<p>The sky of their being thus cleansed with rain and thunder,
and all blue peace again, they were calm enough by and by to
consider the main business of the session&ndash;&ndash;what was to be done
to save the shipyard from destruction?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>Mamise had to repeat most of what she had told, point by
point:</p>
<p>Nicky was not going to wait till the ships were launched or
even finished. He was impatient to strike a resounding blow
at the American program. Nicky was going to let Mamise
know just when the blow was to be struck, so that she might
share in the glory of it when triumphant Germany rewarded
her faithful servants in America. Jake Nuddle was to take
part in the ship-slaughter for the double privilege of protesting
against this capitalistic war and of crippling those cruel capitalists
to whom he owed all his poverty&ndash;&ndash;to hear him tell it.</p>
<p>When Mamise had finished this inventory of the situation
Davidge pondered aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we ought to turn the case over to the Department
of Justice and the Military and Naval Intelligence to
handle, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to shelter my poor sister if I could,&rdquo; said
Mamise. &ldquo;Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t let any tenderness for Jake
Nuddle stand in the way of my patriotic duty, for Heaven
knows he&rsquo;s as much of a traitor to my poor sister as he is to
everything else that&rsquo;s decent, but I&rsquo;d like to keep him out
of it somehow. Something might happen to make it possible,
don&rsquo;t you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might cripple him and send him to a hospital to save his
life,&rdquo; said Davidge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to keep him out of it,&rdquo; said Mamise. &ldquo;If I
should tell the authorities, though, they&rsquo;d put him in jail
right away, wouldn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. And they&rsquo;d run your friend Nicky down and
intern him. Then I&rsquo;d lose my chance to lay hands on him
as&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he did on you,&rdquo; was what he started to say, but he
stopped in time.</p>
<p>This being Davidge&rsquo;s fierce desire, he found plenty of justification
for it in other arguments. In the first place, there was
no telling where Nicky might be. He had given Mamise no
hint of his headquarters. She had neglected to ask where she
could reach him, and had been instructed simply to wait till he
gave her the signal. No doubt he could be picked up somewhere
in the enormous, ubiquitous net with which America
had been gradually covered by the secret services and by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
far-flung line of the American Protective League made up of
private citizens. But there would be a certain unsatisfactoriness
about nipping his plot so far from even the bud.
Prevention is wisdom, but it lacks fascination.</p>
<p>And supposing that they found Nicky, what evidence had
they against him, except Mamise&rsquo;s uncorroborated statement
that he had discussed certain plots with her? Enemy aliens
could be interned without trial, but that meant a halcyon
existence for Nicky and every comfort except liberty. This
was not to be considered. Davidge had a personal grudge,
too, to satisfy. He owed Nicky punishment for sinking the
ship named after Davidge&rsquo;s mother and for planning to sink
the ship he was naming after the woman he hoped to make
his wife.</p>
<p>Davidge was eager to seize Nicky in the very act of planting
his torpedo and hoist him with his own petard. So he counseled
a plan of waiting further developments. Mamise was the
more willing, since it deferred the hateful moment when Jake
Nuddle would be exposed. She had a hope that things might
so happen as to leave him out of the d&eacute;nouement entirely.</p>
<p>And now Davidge and Mamise were in perfect agreement,
conspirators against a conspiracy. And there was the final
note of the terrible in their compact: their failure meant the
demolition of all those growing ships, the nullification of
Davidge&rsquo;s entire contribution to the war; their success would
mean perhaps the death of Easton and the blackening of the
name of Mamise&rsquo;s sister and her sister&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>The solemnity of the outlook made impossible any talk of
love. Davidge left Mamise at her cottage and rode back to
his office, feeling like the commander of a stockade in the time
of an Indian uprising. Mamise found that his foresight had
had the house warmed for her; and there were flowers in a jar.
She smiled at his tenderness even in his wrath. But the sight
of the smoke rolling from the chimney had caught the eye
of her sister, and she found Abbie waiting to welcome her.</p>
<p>The two rushed to each other with the affection of blood-kin,
but Mamise felt like a Judas when she kissed the sister
she was planning to betray. Abbie began at once to recite
a catalogue of troubles. They were sordid and petty, but
Mamise shivered to think how real a tragedy impended. She
wondered how right she was to devastate her sister&rsquo;s life for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
the sake of a cause which, after all, was only the imagined
welfare of millions of total strangers. She could not see the
nation for the people, but her sister was her sister, and pitifully
human. That was the worst wrench of war, the incessant
compulsions to tear the heart away from its natural
moorings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>Davidge thought it only fair to take the Department of
Justice operative, Larrey, into his confidence. Larrey
was perfectly willing to defer reporting to his office chief until
the more dramatic conclusion; for he had an easily understandable
ambition to share in the glory of it. It was agreed
that a closer watch than ever should be kept on the shipyard
and its approaches. Easton had promised to notify Mamise
of his arrival, but he might grow suspicious of her and strike
without warning.</p>
<p>The period of waiting was as maddening as the suspense of
the poor insomniac who implored the man next door to &ldquo;drop
the other shoe.&rdquo; Mamise suffered doubly from her dual
interest in Abbie and in Davidge. She dared not tell Abbie
what was in the wind, though she tried to undermine gradually
the curious devotion Abbie bore to her worthless husband.
But Mamise&rsquo;s criticisms of Jake only spurred Abbie to
new defenses of him and a more loyal affection.</p>
<p>Day followed day, and Mamise found the routine of the
office intolerably monotonous. Time gnawed at her resolution,
and she began to hope to be away when Easton made
his attempt. It occurred to her that it would be pleasant to
have an ocean between her and the crisis. She said to
Davidge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Nicky would come soon, for I have applied for a
passport to France. Major Widdicombe got me the forms to
fill out, and he promised to expedite them. I ought to go
the minute they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information threw Davidge into a complex dismay.
Here was another of Mamise&rsquo;s long-kept secrets. The success
of her plan meant the loss of her, or her indefinite postponement.
It meant more yet. He groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! everybody in the United States is going to
France except me. Even the women are all emigrating. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
think I&rsquo;ll just turn the shipyard over to the other officers of
the corporation and go with you. Let Easton blow it up
then, if he wants to, so long as I get into the uniform and into
the fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new commotion was ended by a shocking and unforeseen
occurrence. The State Department refused to grant
Mamise a passport, and dazed Widdicombe by letting him
know confidentially that Mamise was on the red list of suspects
because of her Germanized past. This was news to
Widdicombe, and he went to Polly in a state of bewilderment.</p>
<p>Polly had never told him what Mamise had told her, but
she had to let out a few of the skeletons in Mamise&rsquo;s closet
now. Widdicombe felt compromised in his own loyalty, but
Polly browbeat him into submission. She wrote to Mamise
and broke the news to her as gently as she could, but the
rebuff was cruel. Mamise took her sorrow to Davidge.</p>
<p>He was furious and proposed to &ldquo;go to the mat&rdquo; with the
State Department. Mamise, however, shook her head; she
saw that her only hope of rehabilitation lay in a positive proof
of her fidelity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got my name stained in England because I didn&rsquo;t have
the pluck to do something positive. I was irresolution personified,
and I&rsquo;m paying for it. But for once in my life I
learned a lesson, and when I learned what Nicky planned I
ran right to you with it. Now if we catch Nicky red-handed,
and I turn over my own brother-in-law to justice, that ought
to redeem me, oughtn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge had a better idea for her protection. &ldquo;Marry me,
and then they can&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll suspect you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Too many good
Americans have been dragged into hot water by pro-German
wives, and I&rsquo;m not going to marry you till I can bring you
some other dower than a spotted reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you and be glad to get you if you were as polka-dotted
as a leopardess,&rdquo; said Davidge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as much obliged; but no, thank you,&rdquo; said Mamise.
&ldquo;Furthermore, if we were married, the news would reach
Nicky Easton through Jake Nuddle, and then Nicky would
lose all trust in me, and come down on us without warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This makes about the fifteenth rejection I&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; said
Davidge. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d sworn never to ask you again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to ask you when the time was ripe,&rdquo; said
Mamise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget. Barkis is always willin&rsquo; and waitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re both waiting,&rdquo; Mamise went on, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
one thing you&rsquo;ve got to do for me, or I&rsquo;ll never propose to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted, to the half my shipyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a job in your shipyard. I can&rsquo;t stand this
typewriter-tapping any longer. I&rsquo;m going mad. I want to
swing a hammer or something. You told me that women
could build a whole ship if they wanted to, and I want to
build my part of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you speak of my hands, I&rsquo;ll prove to you how strong
they are. Besides, if I were out in the yard at work, I could
keep a better watch for Nicky, and I could keep you better
informed as to the troubles always brewing among the workmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m strong enough for it, too. I&rsquo;ve been taking a lot of
exercise recently to get in trim. If you don&rsquo;t believe me,
feel that muscle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flexed her biceps, and he took hold of it timidly in its
silken sleeve. It amazed him, for it was like marble. Still,
he hated to lose her from the neighborliness of the office;
he hated to send her out among the workmen with their rough
language and their undoubted readiness to haze her and teach
her her place. But she was stubborn and he saw that her
threat was in earnest when she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give me a job, I&rsquo;ll go to some other company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he yielded and wrote her a note to the superintendent
of the yard, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can begin to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled in her triumph and made the very womanly
comment: &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t a thing to wear. Do you know a
good ladies&rsquo; tailor who can fit me out with overalls, some one
who has been &lsquo;Breeches-maker to the Queen&rsquo; and can drape
a baby-blue denim pant modishly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upshot of it was that she decided to make her own
trousseau, and she went shopping for materials and patterns.
She ended by visiting an emporium for &ldquo;gents&rsquo; furnishings.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
The storekeeper asked her what size her husband wore, and
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her the smallest suit in stock, and she held it up
against her. It was much too brief, and she was heartened
to know that there were workmen littler than she.</p>
<p>She bought the garment that came nearest to her own
dimensions, and hurried home with it joyously. It proved
to be a perfect misfit, and she worked over it as if it were a
coming-out gown; and indeed it was her costume for her
d&eacute;but into the world of manual labor.</p>
<p>Abbie dropped in and surprised her in her attitudes and was
handsomely scandalized:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When&rsquo;s the masquerade?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Mamise told her of her new career.</p>
<p>Abbie was appalled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the Bible for a woman
to wear a man&rsquo;s things!&rdquo; she protested. Abbie could quote
the Scripture for every discouraging purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather wear them than wash them,&rdquo; said Mamise;
&ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll take my advice you&rsquo;ll get a suit of overalls
yourself and earn an honest living and five times as much
money as Jake would give you&ndash;&ndash;if he ever gave you any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Abbie wailed that Mamise had gone indecent as well
as crazy, and trembled at the thought of what the gossips
along the row would do with the family reputation. The
worst of it was that Mamise had money in the bank and did
not have to work.</p>
<p>That was the incomprehensible thing to Jake Nuddle. He
accepted the familiar theory that all capital is stolen goods,
and he reproached Mamise with the double theft of poor
folks&rsquo; money and now of poor folks&rsquo; work. Mamise&rsquo;s contention
that there were not enough workmen for the country&rsquo;s
needs fell on deaf ears, for Jake believed that work was a
crime against the sacred cause of the laboring-man. His
ideal of a laboring-man was one who seized the capital from
the capitalists and then ceased to labor.</p>
<p>But Jake&rsquo;s too familiar eyes showed that he regarded
Mamise as a very interesting spectacle. The rest of the workmen
seemed to have the same opinion when she went to the
yard in her overalls next morning. She was the first woman
to take up man&rsquo;s work in the neighborhood, and she had to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
endure the most searching stares, grins, frowns, and comments
that were meant to be overheard.</p>
<p>She struck all the men as immodest; some were offended
and some were delighted. As usual, modesty was but another
name for conformity. Mamise had to face the glares of the
conventional wives and daughters in their bodices that followed
every contour, their light skirts that blew above the
knees, and their provocative hats and ribbons. They made it
plain to her that they were outraged by this shapeless passer-by
in the bifurcated potato-sack, with her hair tucked up
under a vizored cap and her hands in coarse mittens.</p>
<p>Mamise had studied the styles affected by the workmen
as if they were fashion-plates from Paris, and she had equipped
herself with a slouchy cap, heavy brogans, a thick sweater,
a woolen shirt, and thick flannels underneath.</p>
<p>She was as well concealed as she could manage, and yet
her femininity seemed to be emphasized by her very disguise.
The roundness of bosom and hip and the fineness of shoulder
differed too much from the masculine outline to be hidden.
And somehow there was more coquetry in her careful carelessness
than in all the exaggerated womanishness of the shanty
belles. She had been a source of constant wonder to the
community from the first. But now she was regarded as a
downright menace to the peace and the morals of society.</p>
<p>Mamise reported to the superintendent and gave him
Davidge&rsquo;s card. The old man respected Davidge&rsquo;s written
orders and remembered the private instructions Davidge
had given him to protect Mamise from annoyance at all
costs. The superintendent treated her as if she were a child
playing at salesmanship in a store. And this was the attitude
of all the men except a few incorrigible gallants, who tried
to start flirtations and make movie dates with her.</p>
<p>Sutton, the master riveter, alone received her with just the
right hospitality. He had no fear that she would steal his
job or his glory or that any man would. He had talked with
her often and let her practise at his riveting-gun. He had
explained that her ambition to be a riveter was hopeless,
since it would take at least three month&rsquo;s apprenticeship
before she could hope to begin on such a career. But her
sincere longings to be a builder and not a loafer won his
respect.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>When she expressed a shy wish to belong to his riveting-gang
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, miss&ndash;&ndash;or should I say mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be proud if you&rsquo;d call me bo,&rdquo; said Mamise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, bo. We&rsquo;ll start you in as a passer-boy.
I&rsquo;ll be glad to get rid of that sleep-walker. Hay, Snotty!&rdquo;
he called to a grimy lad with an old bucket. The youth
rubbed the back of his greasy glove across the snub of nose
that had won him his name, and, shifting his precocious quid,
growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, go git your time&ndash;&ndash;or change to another gang. Tell
the supe. I&rsquo;m not fast enough for you. Go on&ndash;&ndash;beat it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise saw that she already had an enemy. She protested
against displacing another toiler, but Sutton told her
that there were jobs enough for the cub.</p>
<p>He explained the nature of Mamise&rsquo;s duties, talking out
of one side of his mouth and using the other for ejaculations
of an apparently inexhaustible supply of tobacco-juice.
Seeing that Mamise&rsquo;s startled eyes kept following these
missiles, he laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you use chewin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said Mamise, not quite sure of his
meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to keep a wad of gum goin&rsquo;, then, for
you cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y need a lot of spit in this business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise found this true enough, and the next time Davidge
saw her she kept her grinders milling and used the back of her
glove with a professional air. For the present, however, she
had no brain-cells to spare for mastication. Sutton introduced
her to his crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gink here with the whiskers is Zupnik; he&rsquo;s the
holder-on; he handles the dolly and hangs on to the rivets
while I swat &rsquo;em. The pill over by the furnace is the heater;
his name is Pafflow, and his job is warming up the rivets.
Just before they begin to sizzle he yanks &rsquo;em out with the tongs
and throws &rsquo;em to you. You ketch &rsquo;em in the bucket&ndash;&ndash;I
hope, and take &rsquo;em out with your tongs and put &rsquo;em in the
rivet-hole, and then Zupnik and me we do the rest. And what
do we call you? Miss Webling is no name for a workin&rsquo;-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Marie Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Moll is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Moll she was thenceforth.</p>
<p>The understanding of Mamise&rsquo;s task was easier than its
performance. Pafflow sent the rivets to her fast and fleet,
and they were red-hot. The first one passed her and struck
Sutton. His language blistered. The second sizzled against
her hip. The third landed in the pail with a pleasant clink,
but she was so slow in getting her tongs about it, and fitting
it into its place, that it was too cold for use. This threw her
into a state of hopelessness. She was ready to resign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better go back to crocheting,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<p>Sutton gave her a playful shove that almost sent her off
the platform:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, you don&rsquo;t, Moll. You made me chase Snotty
off the job, and you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; t&rsquo;rough wit&rsquo; it. You ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo;
no worse &rsquo;n I done meself when I started rivetin&rsquo;. Cheese! but
I spoiled so much work I got me tail kicked offen me a dozen
times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was politer language than some that he used. His
conversation was interspersed with words that no one prints.
They scorched Mamise&rsquo;s ears like red-hot rivets at first, but
she learned to accept them as mere emphasis. And, after all,
blunt Anglo-Saxon never did any harm that Latin paraphrase
could prevent.</p>
<p>The main thing was Sutton&rsquo;s rough kindliness, his splendid
efficiency, and his infinite capacity for taking pains with each
rivet-head, hammering it home, then taking up his pneumatic
chipping-tool to trim it neat. That is the genius and the glory
of the artisan, to perfect each detail <i>ad unguem</i>, like a poet
truing up a sonnet.</p>
<p>Sutton was putting in thousands on thousands of rivets
a month, and every one of them was as important to him as
every other. He feared the thin knife-blade of the rivet-tester
as the scrupulous writer dreads the learned critic&rsquo;s
scalpel.</p>
<p>Mamise was dazed to learn that the ship named after her
would need nearly half a million rivets, each one of them necessary
to the craft&rsquo;s success. The thought of the toil, the noise,
the sweat, the money involved made the work a sort of temple-building,
and the thought of Nicky Easton&rsquo;s ability to annul
all that devout accomplishment in an instant nauseated her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
like a blasphemy. She felt herself a priestess in a holy office
and renewed her flagging spirits with prayers for strength and
consecration.</p>
<p>But few of the laborers had Sutton&rsquo;s pride or Mamise&rsquo;s
piety in the work. Just as she began to get the knack of
catching and placing the rivets Pafflow began to register his
protest against her sex. He took a low joy in pitching rivets
wild, and grinned at her dancing lunges after them.</p>
<p>Mamise would not tattle, but she began again to lose heart.
Sutton&rsquo;s restless appetite for rivets noted the new delay, and
he grasped the cause of it at once. His first comment was
to walk over to the furnace and smash Pafflow in the nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try any of that I. W. W. sabotodge here, you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, and
I&rsquo;ll stuff you in a rivet-hole and turn the gun loose on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pafflow yielded first to force and later to the irresistible
power of Mamise&rsquo;s humility. Indeed, her ardor for service
warmed his indifferent soul at last, and he joined with her to
make a brilliant team, hurtling the rivets in red arcs from the
coke to the pail with the precision of a professional baseball
battery.</p>
<p>Mamise eventually acquired a womanly deftness in plucking
up the rivet and setting it in place, and Davidge might
have seen grounds for uneasiness in her eager submissiveness
to Sutton as she knelt before him, watched his eye timidly,
and glowed like coke under the least breath of his approval.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>Sutton was a mighty man in his way, and earning a wage
that would have been accounted princely a year before. All
the workers were receiving immense increase of pay, but the
champion riveters were lavishly rewarded.</p>
<p>The whole shipyard industry was on a racing basis. Plans
were being laid to celebrate the next Fourth of July with an
unheard-of number of launchings. Every boat-building company
was trying to put overboard an absolute maximum of
hulls on that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry-up&rdquo; Hurley, who had driven the first rivets into
a steel ship pneumatically, and Charles M. Schwab, of Bethlehem,
were the inspiring leaders in the rush, and their ambition
was to multiply the national output by ten. The spirit of
emulation thrilled all the thrillable workmen, but the riveters
were the spectacular favorites. Their names appeared in the
papers as they topped each other&rsquo;s scores, and Sutton kept
outdoing himself. For special occasions he groomed himself
like a race-horse, resting the day before the great event and
then giving himself up to a frenzy of speed.</p>
<p>On one noble day of nine hours&rsquo; fury he broke the world&rsquo;s
record temporarily. He drove four thousand eight hundred
and seventy-five three-quarter-inch rivets into place. Then
he was carried away to a twenty-four-hour rest, like an exhausted
prizefighter.</p>
<p>That was one of the great days in Mamise&rsquo;s history, for
she was permitted to assist in the achievement, and she was
not entirely grateful to Davidge for suppressing the publication
of her name alongside Sutton&rsquo;s. Her photograph appeared
with his in many of the supplements, but nobody
recognized the lily-like beauty of Miss Webling in the smutty-faced
passer-boy crouching at Sutton&rsquo;s elbow. The publication
of her photograph as an English belle had made history
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
for her, in that it brought Jake Nuddle into her life; but this
picture had no follow-up except in her own pride.</p>
<p>This rapture, however, long postdated her first adventure
into the shipyard. That grim period of eight hours was an
alternation of shame, awkwardness, stupidity, failure, fatigue,
and despair.</p>
<p>She did not even wash up for lunch, but picked her fodder
from her pail with her companions. She smoked a convivial
cigarette with the gang and was proud as a boy among grown-ups.
She even wanted to be tough and was tempted to use
ugly words in a swaggering pride.</p>
<p>But after her lunch it was almost impossible for her to get
up and go back to her task, and she would have fainted from
sheer weariness except that she had forsworn such luxuries
as swoons.</p>
<p>The final whistle found her one entire neuralgia. The unending
use of the same muscles, the repetition of the same
rhythmic series, the cranium-shattering clatter of all the
riveting-guns, the anxiety to be sure of each successive rivet,
quite burned her out. And she learned that the reward for
this ordeal was, according to the minimum wage-scale adopted
by the Emergency Fleet Corporation, thirty cents an hour
for eight hours, with a ten-per-cent. increase for a six-day
week. This would amount to all of two dollars and sixty-four
cents for the day, and fifteen dollars for the week!</p>
<p>It was munificent for a passer-boy, but it was ruinous for a
young woman of independent fortune and an ambition to
look her best. She gasped with horror when she realized the
petty reward for such prolonged torment. She was too weary
to contrast the wage with the prices of food, fuel, and clothing.
While wages climbed expenses soared.</p>
<p>She understood as never before, and never after, why labor
is discontent and why it is so easily stirred to rebellion,
why it feels itself the exploited slave of imaginary tyrants.
She went to bed at eight and slept in the deeps of sweat-earned
repose.</p>
<p>The next morning, getting up was like scourging a crowd
of fagged-out children to school. All her limbs and sundry
muscles whose existence she had never realized before were
like separate children, each aching and wailing: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t!
I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>But the lameness vanished when she was at work again,
and her sinews began to learn their various trades and to
manage them automatically. She grew strong and lusty,
and her task grew easy. She began to understand that while
the employee has troubles enough and to spare, he has none
of the torments of leadership; he is not responsible for the
securing of contracts and materials, for borrowings of capital
from the banks, or for the weekly nightmare of meeting the
pay-roll. There are two hells in the cosmos of manufacture:
the dark pit where the laborer fights the tiny worms of expense
and the dizzy crags where the employer battles with the
dragons of aggregates.</p>
<p>Mamise saw that most of the employees were employees
because they lacked the self-starter of ambition. They were
lazy-minded, and even their toiling bodies were lazy. For all
their appearance of effort they did not ordinarily attain an
efficiency of thirty per cent. of their capabilities. The turnover
in employment was three times what it should have been.
Three hundred men were hired for every hundred steadily at
work, and the men at work did only a third of the work they
could have done. The total wastefulness of man rivaled the
ghastly wastefulness of nature with spawn and energy.</p>
<p>The poor toilers were more reckless, more shiftless, relatively
more dissipated, than the idle rich, for the rich ordinarily
squandered only the interest on their holdings, while the
laborer wasted his capital in neglecting to make full use of
his muscle. The risks they took with life and limb were
amazing.</p>
<p>On Saturdays great numbers quit work and waited for their
pay. On Mondays the force was greatly reduced by absentees
nursing the hang-over from the Sunday drunk, and of those
that came to work so many were unfit that the Monday
accident increase was proverbial.</p>
<p>The excuse of slavery or serfdom was no longer legitimate,
though it was loudly proclaimed by the agitators, the trade-union
editors, and the parlor reformers. For, say what they
would, labor could resign or strike at will; the laborer had his
vote and his equality of opportunity. He was free even
from the ordinary obligations, for nobody expected the
workman to make or keep a contract for his services after it
became inconvenient to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>There were bad sports among them, as among the rich and
the classes between. There were unions and individuals
that were tyrants in power and cry-babies in trouble. There
was much cruelty, trickery, and despotism inside the unions&ndash;&ndash;ferocious
jealousy of union against union, and mutual destructiveness.</p>
<p>This was, of course, inevitable, and it only proved that
lying, cheating, and bullying were as natural to the so-called
&ldquo;laborer&rdquo; as to the so-called &ldquo;capitalist.&rdquo; The folly is in
making the familiar distinction between them. Mamise saw
that the majority of manual laborers did not do a third of the
work they might have done and she knew that many of the
capitalists did three times as much as they had to.</p>
<p>It is the individual that tells the story, and Mamise, who
had known hard-working, firm-muscled men, and devoted
mothers and pure daughters among the rich, found them also
among the poor, but intermingled here, as above, with sots,
degenerates, child-beaters, and wantons.</p>
<p>Mamise learned to admire and to be fond of many of the
men and their families. But she had adventures with blackguards,
rakes, and brutes. She was lovingly entreated by
many a dear woman, but she was snubbed and slandered by
others who were as extravagant, indolent, and immoral as
the wives and daughters of the rich.</p>
<p>But all in all, the ship-builders loafed horribly in spite of
the poetic inspiration of their calling and the prestige of
public laudation; in spite of the appeals for hulls to carry
food to the starving and troops to the anxious battle-front of
Europe. In spite also of the highest wages ever paid to a
craft, they kept their efficiency at a lower point than lower
paid workmen averaged in the listless pre-war days. Yet there
was no lack of outcry that the workman was throttled and
enslaved by the greed of capital. There was no lack of outcry
that profiteers were bleeding the nation to death and making
martyrs of the poor.</p>
<p>Most of the capitalists had been workmen themselves and
had risen from the lethargic mass by the simple expedient of
using their brains for schemes and making their muscles
produce more than the average output. The laborers who
failed failed because when they got their eight-hour day
they did not turn their leisure to production. And some of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
them dared to claim that the manual toilers alone produced the
wealth and should alone be permitted to enjoy it, as if it were
possible or desirable to choke off initiative and adventure or
to devise a society in which the man whose ambition is to
avoid work will set the pace for the man who loves it for
itself and whose discontent goads him on to self-improvement!
As if it were possible or desirable for the man who works half-heartedly
eight hours a day to keep down the man who works
whole-souledly eighteen hours a day! For time is power.</p>
<p>Even the benefits the modern laborer enjoys are largely
the result of intervention in his behalf by successful men of
enterprise who thrust upon the toiler the comforts, the safeguards,
and the very privileges he will not or cannot seek for
himself.</p>
<p>During the war the employers of labor, the generals of these
tremendous armies, were everlastingly alert to find some
means to stimulate them to do themselves justice. The best
artists of the country devised eloquent posters, and these were
stuck up everywhere, reminding the laborer that he was the
partner of the soldier. Orators visited the yards and harangued
the men. After each appeal there was a brief spurt
of enthusiasm that showed what miracles could be accomplished
if they had not lapsed almost at once into the usual
sullen drudgery.</p>
<p>There were appeals to thrift also. The government needed
billions of dollars, needed them so badly that the pennies of
the poorest man must be sought for. Few of the workmen
had the faintest idea of saving. The wives of some of them
were humbly provident, but many of them were debt-runners
in the shops and wasters in the kitchens.</p>
<p>A gigantic effort was put forth to teach the American people
thrift. The idea of making small investments in government
securities was something new. Bonds were supposed to be
for bankers and plutocrats. Vast campaigns of education
were undertaken, and the rich implored the poor to lay aside
something for a rainy day. The rich invented schemes to
wheedle the poor to their own salvation. So huge had been
the wastefulness before that the new fashion produced billions
upon billions of investments in Liberty Bonds, and hundreds
of millions in War Savings Stamps.</p>
<p>Bands of missionaries went everywhere, to the theaters,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
the moving-picture houses, the schools, the shops, the factories,
preaching the new gospel of good business and putting it
across in the name of patriotism.</p>
<p>One of these troupes of crusaders marched upon Davidge&rsquo;s
shipyard. And with it came Nicky Easton at last.</p>
<p>Easton had deferred his advent so long that Mamise and
Davidge had come almost to yearn for him with heartsick
eagerness. The first inkling of the prodigal&rsquo;s approach was a
visit that Jake Nuddle paid to Mamise late one evening. She
had never broached to him the matter of her talk with Easton,
waiting always for him to speak of it to her. She was amazed
to see him now, and he brought amazement with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just got a call on long distance,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a certain
party tells me you was one of us all this time. Why didn&rsquo;t
you put a feller wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise was inspired to answer his reproach with a better:
&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t trust you, Jake. You talk too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This robbed Jake of his bluster and convinced him that
the elusive Mamise was some tremendous super-spy. He
became servile at once, and took pride in being the lackey
of her unexplained and unexplaining majesty. Mamise liked
him even less in this r&ocirc;le than the other.</p>
<p>She took his information with a languid indifference, as if
the terrifying news were simply a tiresome confirmation of what
she had long expected. Jake was tremulous with excitement
and approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, who&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought our little Mamise was one
of them slouch-hounds you read about? I see now why
you&rsquo;ve been stringin&rsquo; that Davidge boob along. You got
him eatin&rsquo; out your hand. And I see now why you put them
jumpers on and went out into the yards. You just got to
know everything, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise nodded and smiled felinely, as she imagined a
queen of mystery would do. But as soon as she could get rid
of Jake she was like a child alone in a graveyard.</p>
<p>Jake had told her that Nicky would be down in a few days,
and not to be surprised when he appeared. She wanted to
get the news to Davidge, but she dared not go to his rooms
so late. And in the morning she was due at her job of passing
rivets. She crept into bed to rest her dog-tired bones against
the morrow&rsquo;s problems. Her dreams were all of death and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
destruction, and of steel ships crumpled like balls of paper
thrown into a waste-basket.</p>
<p>If she had but known it, Davidge was making the rounds
of his sentry-line. The guard at one gate was sound asleep.
He found two others playing cards, and a fourth man dead
drunk.</p>
<p>Inside the yards the great hulls rose up to the moon like
the buttresses of a cliff. Only, they were delicately vulnerable,
and Europe waited for them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>True sleep came to Mamise so late that her alarm-clock
could hardly awaken her. It took all her speed to get
her to her post. She dared not keep Sutton waiting, and fear
of the time-clock had become a habit with her. As she caught
the gleaming rivets and thrust them into their sconces, she
wondered if all this toil were merely a waste of effort to give
the sarcastic gods another laugh at human folly.</p>
<p>She wanted to find Davidge and took at last the desperate
expedient of pretended sickness. The passer-boy Snotty was
found to replace her, and she hurried to Davidge&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Miss Gabus stared at her and laughed. &ldquo;Tired of your
rivetin&rsquo; a&rsquo;ready? Come to get your old job back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise shook her head and asked for Davidge. He was
out&ndash;&ndash;no, not out of town, but out in the yard or the shop or
up in the mold-loft or somewheres, she reckoned.</p>
<p>Mamise set out to find him, and on the theory that among
places to look for anything or anybody the last should be first
she climbed the long, long stairs to the mold-loft.</p>
<p>He was not among the acolytes kneeling at the templates;
nor was he in the cathedral of the shop. She sought him
among the ships, and came upon him at last talking to Jake
Nuddle, of all people!</p>
<p>Nuddle saw Mamise first and winked, implying that he also
was making a fool of Davidge. Davidge looked sheepish,
as he always did when he was caught in a benevolent act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just talking to your brother-in-law, Miss Webling,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;trying to drive a few rivets into that loose skull.
I don&rsquo;t want to fire him, on your account, but I don&rsquo;t see why
I should pay an I. W. W. or a Bolshevist to poison my
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge had been alarmed by the indifference of his sentinels.
He thought it imbecile to employ men like Nuddle to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
corrupt the men within, while the guards admitted any
wanderer from without. He was making a last attempt to
convert Nuddle to industry for Mamise&rsquo;s sake, trying to
pluck this dingy brand from the burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just showing Nuddle a little bookkeeping in patriotism,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;The Liberty Loan people are coming here,
and I want the yard to do itself proud. Some of the men
and women are going without necessities to help the government,
while Nuddle and some others are working for the
Kaiser. This is the record of Nuddle and his crew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wages, six to ten dollars a day guaranteed by the government.
Investment in Liberty Bonds, nothing; purchases of
War Savings Stamps, nothing; contributions to Red Cross,
Y. M. C. A., K. of C., J. W. B., Salvation Army, nothing;
contributions to relief funds of the Allies, nothing. Time
spent at drill, none; time spent in helping recruiting, none.
A clean sheet, and a sheet full of time spent in interfering with
other men&rsquo;s work, sneering at patriotism, saying the Kaiser is
no worse than the Allies, pretending that this is a war to please
the capitalists, and that a soldier is a fool.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, Nuddle, you are doing the Germans&rsquo; business,
and I don&rsquo;t intend to pay you American money any
longer unless you do more work with your hands and less
with your jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nuddle was stupid enough to swagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, Davidge. You&rsquo;ll change your tune
before long, because us workin&rsquo;-men, bein&rsquo; the perdoocers, are
goin&rsquo; to take over all these plants and run &rsquo;em to soot ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;And will you take over my loans
at the banks to meet the pay-rolls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take over the banks!&rdquo; said Jake, majestically.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take over everything and let the workin&rsquo;-men git their
doos at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What becomes of us wicked plutocrats?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have you workin&rsquo; for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be the workin&rsquo;-men, and it will be our turn
to take over things and set you plutocrats to workin&rsquo; for us,
I suppose. And we&rsquo;ll be just where we are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was growing too seesawy for Nuddle, and he turned
surly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of you won&rsquo;t be in no shape to take over
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as bad as that, eh? Well, while
I can, I&rsquo;ll just take over your button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m fired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Davidge, holding out his hand for the
badge that served as a pass to the yards and the pay-roll.
&ldquo;Come with me, and you&rsquo;ll get what money&rsquo;s coming to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This struck through Nuddle&rsquo;s thick wits. He cast a glance
of dismay at Mamise. If he were discharged, he could not
help Easton with the grand blow-up. He whined:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you no regard for a family man? I got a wife and
kids dependent on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do what Karl Marx did&ndash;&ndash;let them starve or live on
their own money while you prove that capital is as he said, &lsquo;a
vampire of dead labor sucking the life out of living labor.&rsquo;
Or feed them on the wind you try to sell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, have a heart! I talk too much, but I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo;
Jake pleaded.</p>
<p>Davidge relented a little. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll promise to give your
mouth a holiday and your hands a little work I&rsquo;ll keep you
to the end of the month. And then, on your way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boss; much obliged,&rdquo; said Jake, so relieved at
his respite that he bustled away as if victorious, winking
shrewdly at Mamise&ndash;&ndash;who winked back, with some difficulty.</p>
<p>She waited till he was a short distance off, then she murmured,
quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump&ndash;&ndash;but Nicky Easton is coming here in the
next few days; I don&rsquo;t know just when. He told Jake;
Jake told me. What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge took the blow with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our little guest is coming at last, eh? He promised to
see you first. I&rsquo;ll have Larrey keep close to you, and the
first move he makes we&rsquo;ll jump him. In the mean while
I&rsquo;ll put some new guards on the job and&ndash;&ndash;well, that&rsquo;s about
all we can do but wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t be seen speaking to you too friendly. Jake
thinks I&rsquo;m fooling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help me, if you are, for I love you. And I want
you to be careful. Don&rsquo;t run any risks. I&rsquo;d rather have the
whole shipyard smashed than your little finger.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but if I could swap my life for one ship it would
be the best bargain I ever bought. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she ran back to her post Davidge smiled at the womanishness
of her gait, and thought of Joan of Arc, never so
lovably feminine as in her armor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Days of harrowing restiveness followed, Mamise starting
at every word spoken to her, leaping to her feet at every
step that passed her cottage, springing from her sleep with a
cry, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; at every breeze that fumbled a shutter.</p>
<p>But nothing happened; nobody came for her.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the Liberty Loan drive was declared a
half-holiday. The guards were doubled at the gates, and
watchmen moved among the crowds; but strangers were admitted
if they looked plausible, and several motor-loads of
them rolled in. Some of them carried bundles of circulars
and posters and application blanks. Some of them were of
foreign aspect, since a large number of the workmen had to
be addressed in other languages than English.</p>
<p>Mamise drifted from one audience to another. She encountered
her team-mate Pafflow and tried to find a speaker
who was using his language.</p>
<p>At length a voice of an intonation familiar to him threw
him into an ecstasy. What was jargon to Mamise was native
music to him, and she lingered at his elbow, pretending to
share his thrill in order to increase it.</p>
<p>She felt a twitch at her sleeve, and turned idly.</p>
<p>Nicky Easton was at her side. Her mind, all her minds,
began to convene in alarm like the crew of a ship attacked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicky!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No names, pleass! But to follow me quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right with you.&rdquo; She turned to follow him. &ldquo;One
minute.&rdquo; She stepped back and spoke fiercely to Pafflow.
&ldquo;Pafflow, find Mr. Davidge. Tell him Nicky is here. Remember,
<i>Nicky is here</i>. It&rsquo;s life and death. Find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pafflow mumbled, &ldquo;Nicky is here!&rdquo; and Mamise ran after
Nicky, who was lugging a large suit-case. He was quivering
with excitement.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t knew you in pentaloons, but Chake Nuttle pointet
you owit,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-where is Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes ahead vit a boondle of bombs. Nobody is on the
<i>Schiff</i>. Ve could not have so good a chence again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise might have, ought to have, seized him and cried
for help; but she could not somehow throw off the character
she had assumed with Nicky. She obeyed him in a kind of
automatism. Her eyes searched the crowd for Larrey, who
had kept all too close to her of recent days and nights. But
he had fallen under the hypnotism of some too eloquent spellbinder.</p>
<p>Mamise felt the need of doing a great heroic feat, but she
could not imagine what it might be. Pending the arrival
from heaven of some superfeminine inspiration, she simply
went along to be in at the death.</p>
<p>Pafflow was a bit stupid and two bits stubborn. He puzzled
over Mamise&rsquo;s peculiar orders. He wanted to hear the
rest of that fiery speech. He turned and stared after Mamise
and noted the way she went, with the foppish stranger carrying
the heavy baggage. But he was used to obeying orders
after a little balking, and in time his slow brain started him
on the hunt for Davidge. He quickened his pace and asked
questions, being put off or directed hither and yon.</p>
<p>At last he saw the boss sitting on a platform behind whose
fluttering bunting a white-haired man was hurling noises at
the upturned faces of the throng. Pafflow supposed that his
jargon was English.</p>
<p>Getting to Davidge was not easy. But Pafflow was stubborn.
He pushed as close to the front as he could, and there
a wall of bodies held him.</p>
<p>The orator was checked in full career with almost fatal
results by the sudden bellowing of a voice from the crowd
below. He supposed that he was being heckled. He paused
among the ruins of his favorite period, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my friend, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pafflow ignored him and shouted: &ldquo;Meesta Davutch!
O-o-h, Meesta Davutch. Neecky is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge, hearing his name bruited, rose and called into the
mob, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neecky is here.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>When Davidge understood he was staggered. For a moment
he stood in a stupor. Then he apologized to the speaker.
&ldquo;An emergency call. Please forgive me and go right on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed to the other distinguished guests and left the
platform. Pafflow found him and explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moll, the passer-boy, my gang, she say find you, life and
death, and say Neecky is here! I doan&rsquo; know what she means,
but now I find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way&ndash;&ndash;where&ndash;&ndash;did you&ndash;&ndash;have you an idea where
she went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She go over by new ship <i>Mamise</i>&ndash;&ndash;weeth gentleman all
dressy up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge ran toward the scaffolding surrounding the almost
finished hull. He recognized one or two of his plain-clothes
guards and stopped just long enough to tell them to get together
and search every ship at once, and to make no excitement
about it.</p>
<p>The scaffolding was like a jungle, and he prowled through
it with caution and desperate speed, up and down the swaying,
cleated planks and in and out of the hull.</p>
<p>He searched the hold first, expecting that Nicky would
naturally plant his explosives there. That indeed was his
scheme, but Mamise had found among her tumbled wits one
little idea only, and that was to delay Nicky as long as
possible.</p>
<p>She suggested to him that before he began to lay his train
of wires he ought to get a general view of the string of ships.
The best point was the top deck, where they were just about
to hoist the enormous rudder to the stern-post.</p>
<p>Nicky accepted the suggestion, and Mamise guided him
through the labyrinth. They had met Jake at the base of
the falsework, and he came along, leaving his bundle. Nicky
carried his suit-case with him. He did not intend to be
separated from it. Jake was always glad to be separated
from work.</p>
<p>They made the climb, and Nicky&rsquo;s artistic soul lingered to
praise the beautiful day for the beautiful deed. In a frenzy
of talk, Mamise explained to him what she could. She
pointed to the great hatchway for the locomotives and told
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship would have been in the water now if it weren&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
for that big hatch. It set us&ndash;&ndash;the company back ninety
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now the ship goes to be in the sky in about nine
minutes. Come along once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down here, how deep it is!&rdquo; said Mamise, and led
him to the edge. She was ready to thrust him into the
pit, but he kept a firm grip on a rope, and she sighed with
regret.</p>
<p>But Davidge, looking up from the depth of the well, saw
Nicky and Mamise peering over the edge. His face vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who iss?&rdquo; said Nicky. &ldquo;Somebody is below dere. Who
iss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise said she did not know, and Jake had not seen.</p>
<p>Nicky was in a flurry. The fire in Davidge&rsquo;s eyes told him
that Davidge was looking for him. There was a dull sound
in the hitherto silent ship of some one running.</p>
<p>Nicky grew hysterical with wrath. To be caught at the
very outset of his elaborate campaign was maddening. He
opened his suit-case, took out from the protecting wadding
a small iron death-machine and held it in readiness. A noble
plan had entered his brain for rescuing his dream.</p>
<p>Nuddle, glancing over the side, recognized Davidge and
told Nicky who it was that came. When Davidge reached the
top deck, he found Nicky smiling with the affability of a
floorwalker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meester Davitch&ndash;&ndash;please, one momend. I holt in my
hant a little machine to blow us all high-sky if you are so
unkind to be impolite. You move&ndash;&ndash;I srow. We all go up
togedder in much pieces. Better it is you come with me and
make no trouble, and then I let you safe your life. You agree,
yes? Or must I srow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge looked at the bomb, at Nicky, at Nuddle, then
at Mamise. Life was sweet here on this high steel crag, with
the cheers of the crowds about the stands coming faintly up
on the delicious breeze. He knew explosives. He had seen
them work. He could see what that handful of lightning in
Nicky&rsquo;s grasp would do to this mountain he had built.</p>
<p>Life was sweet where the limpid river spread its indolent
floods far and wide. And Mamise was beautiful. The one
thing not sweet and not beautiful was the triumph of this sardonic
Hun.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>Davidge pondered but did not speak.</p>
<p>With all the superiority of the Kultured German for the
untutored Yankee, Nicky said, &ldquo;Vell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the V that did it. For Davidge, without a
word, went for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>The most tremendous explosives refuse to explode unless
some detonator like fulminate of mercury is set off first.
Each of us has his own fulminate, and the snap of a little
cap of it brings on our cataclysm.</p>
<p>It was a pity, seeing how many Germans were alienated
from their country by the series of its rulers&rsquo; crimes, and seeing
how many German names were in the daily lists of our dead,
that the word and the accent grew so hateful to the American
people. It was a pity, but the Americans were not to blame
if the very intonation of a Teutonism made their ears tingle.</p>
<p>Davidge prized life and had no suicidal inclinations or
temptations. No imaginable crisis in his affairs could have
convinced him to self-slaughter. He was brave, but cautious.</p>
<p>Even now, if Nicky Easton, poising the bombshell with its
appalling threat, had murmured a sardonic &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Davidge
would probably have smiled, shrugged, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the bead on me, partner. I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo; He
would have gone along as Nicky&rsquo;s prisoner, waiting some
better chance to recover his freedom.</p>
<p>But the mal-pronunciation of the shibboleth strikes deep
centers of racial feeling and makes action spring faster than
thought. The Sicilians at vespers asked the Frenchmen to
pronounce &ldquo;cheecheree,&rdquo; and slew them when they said
&ldquo;sheesheree.&rdquo; So Easton snapped a fulminate in Davidge when
his Prussian tongue betrayed him into that impertinent, intolerable
alien &ldquo;Vell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge was helpless in his own frenzy. He leaped.</p>
<p>Nicky could not believe his eyes. He paused for an instant&rsquo;s
consideration. As a football-player hesitates a sixteenth
of a second too long before he passes the ball or punts
it, and so forfeits his opportunity, so Nicky Easton stood and
stared for the length of time it takes the eyes to widen.</p>
<p>That was just too long for him and just long enough for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
Davidge, who went at him football fashion, hurling himself
through the air like a vast, sprawling tarantula. Nicky&rsquo;s
grip on the bomb relaxed. It fell from his hand. Davidge
swiped at it wildly, smacked it, and knocked it out of bounds
beyond the deck. Then Davidge&rsquo;s hundred-and-eighty-pound
weight smote the light and wickery frame of Nicky
and sent him collapsing backward, staggering, wavering, till
he, too, went overboard.</p>
<p>Davidge hit the deck like a ball-player sliding for a base,
and he went slithering to the edge. He would have followed
Nicky over the hundred-foot steel precipice if Mamise had
not flung herself on him and caught his heel. He was stopped
with his right arm dangling out in space and his head at
the very margin of the deck.</p>
<p>In this very brief meanwhile Jake Nuddle, who had been
panic-stricken at the sight of the bomb in Nicky&rsquo;s hand, had
been backing away slowly. He would have backed into the
abyss if he had not struck a stanchion and clutched it desperately.</p>
<p>And now the infernal-machine reached bottom. It lighted
on the huge blade of the ship&rsquo;s anchor lying on a wharf waiting
to be hoisted into place. The shell burst with an all-rending
roar and sprayed rags of steel in every direction.
The upward stream caught Nicky in midair and shattered
him to shreds.</p>
<p>Nuddle&rsquo;s whole back was obliterated and half a corpse
fell forward, headless, on the deck. Davidge&rsquo;s right arm was
ripped from the shoulder and his hat vanished, all but the
brim.</p>
<p>Mamise was untouched by the bombardment, but the downward
rain of fragments tore her flesh as she lay sidelong.</p>
<p>The bomb, exploding in the open air, lost much of its
efficiency, but the part of the ship nearest was crumpled like
an old tomato-can that a boy has placed on a car track to
be run over.</p>
<p>The crash with its reverberations threw the throngs about
the speakers&rsquo; stands into various panics, some running away
from the volcano, some toward it. Many people were
knocked down and trampled.</p>
<p>Larrey and his men were the first to reach the deck. They
found Davidge and Mamise in a pool of blood rapidly enlarging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
as the torn arteries in Davidge&rsquo;s shoulder spouted his life
away. A quick application of first aid saved him until the
surgeon attached to the shipyard could reach him.</p>
<p>Mamise&rsquo;s injuries were painful and cruel, but not dangerous.
Of Jake Nuddle there was not enough left to assure Larrey of
his identification. Of Nicky Easton there was so little trace
that the first searchers did not know that he had perished.</p>
<p>Davidge and Mamise were taken to the hospital, and
when Davidge was restored to consciousness his first words
were a groan of awful satisfaction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a German!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he learned that he had no longer a right arm he
smiled again and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to be wounded for your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was a rather inelegant paraphrase of the classic
&ldquo;<i>Dulce et decorum</i>,&rdquo; but caught its spirit admirably.</p>
<p>Of Jake Nuddle he knew nothing and forgot everything
till some days later, when he was permitted to speak to Mamise,
in whose welfare he was more interested than his own, and
the story of whose unimportant wounds harrowed him more
than his own.</p>
<p>Her voice came to him over the bedside telephone. After
an exchange of the inevitable sympathies and regrets and
tendernesses, Mamise sighed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re luckier than poor Jake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are? What happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was killed, horribly. His pitiful wife! Abbie has
been here and she is inconsolable. He was her idol&ndash;&ndash;not a
very pretty one, but idols are not often pretty. It&rsquo;s too
terribly bad, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge&rsquo;s bewildered silence was his epitaph for Jake.
Even though he were dead, one could hardly praise him, though,
now that he was dead, Davidge felt suddenly that he must
have been indeed the first and the eternal victim of his own
qualities.</p>
<p>Jake had been a complainer, a cynic, a loafer always from
his cradle on&ndash;&ndash;indeed, his mother used to say that he nearly
kicked her to death before he was born.</p>
<p>Mamise had hated and loathed him, but she felt now that
Abbie had been righter than she in loving the wretch who had
been dowered with no beauty of soul or body.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>She waited for Davidge to say something. After a long
silence, she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say anything about poor Jake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt it hateful to withhold praise from the dead, and
yet a kind of honesty forced him to oppose the habit of lauding
all who have just died, since it cheapened the praise of
the dead who deserve praise&ndash;&ndash;or what we call &ldquo;deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise spoke in a curiously unnatural tone: &ldquo;It was
noble of poor Jake to give his life trying to save the ship,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said Davidge, and she spoke with labored
precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that you and I, who were the only witnesses, feel
sorry that poor Jake had to be killed in the struggle with
Easton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see! Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes,&rdquo; said Davidge, understanding.</p>
<p>Mamise went on: &ldquo;Mr. Larrey was here and he didn&rsquo;t know
who Jake was till I told him how he helped you try to disarm
Nicky. It will be a fine thing for poor Abbie and her
children to remember that, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge&rsquo;s heart ached with a sudden appreciation of the
sweet purpose of Mamise&rsquo;s falsehood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give Abbie a pension on his
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was done. It pleased a sardonic fate to let Jake
Nuddle pose in his tomb as the benefactor he had always
pretended to be.</p>
<p>The operative, Larrey, had made many adverse reports
against him, but in the blizzard of reports against hundreds
of thousands of suspects that turned the Department of
Justice files into a huge snowdrift these earlier accounts of
Nuddle&rsquo;s treasonable utterances and deeds were forgotten.</p>
<p>The self-destruction of Nicky Easton took its brief space in
the newspapers overcrowded with horrors, and he, too, was
all but forgotten.</p>
<p>When, after some further time, Mamise was able to call
upon Davidge in her wheeled chair, she found him strangely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
lacking in cordiality. She was bitterly hurt at first, until
she gleaned from his manner that he was trying to remove
himself gracefully from her heart because of his disability.</p>
<p>She amazed him by her sudden laughter. He was always
slow to understand why his most solemn or angry humor gave
her so much amusement.</p>
<p>While her nurse and his were talking at a little distance it
pleased her to lean close to Davidge and tease him excruciatingly
with a flirtatious manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before very long I&rsquo;m going to take up that bet we made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the next proposal would come from me. I&rsquo;m going
to propose the first of next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll refuse you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she understood him perfectly, it pleased her to
assume a motive he had never dreamed of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m going to be an invalid for
life. The doctor says I&rsquo;ll be as well as ever in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge could not see how he was to tell her that he didn&rsquo;t
mean that without telling her just what he did mean. In his
tormented petulance he turned his back on her and groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go away and let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was laughing beyond the limits called ladylike as she
began to wheel her chair toward the door. The nurse ran
after her, asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise assured, &ldquo;Nothing on earth, but a lot in heaven,&rdquo;
and would not explain the riddle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Davidge was the modern ideal of an executive. He
appeared never to do any work. He kept an empty
desk and when he was away no one missed him. He would
not use a roll-top desk, but sat at a flat table with nothing
on it but a memorandum-pad, a calendar, an &ldquo;in&rdquo; and an
&ldquo;out&rdquo; basket, both empty most of the time.</p>
<p>He had his work so organized that it went on in his absence
as if he were there. He insisted that the executives of the
departments should follow the same rule. If they were
struck down in battle their places were automatically supplied
as in the regular army.</p>
<p>So when Davidge went to the hospital the office machine
went on as if he had gone to lunch.</p>
<p>Mamise called on him oftener than he had called on her.
She left the hospital in a few days after the explosion, but
she did not step into his office and run the corporation for
him as a well-regulated heroine of recent fiction would have
done. She did not feel that she knew enough. And she
did not know enough. She kept to her job with the riveting-gang
and expected to be discharged any day for lack of pull
with the new boss.</p>
<p>But while she lasted she was one of the gang, and proud of
it. She was neither masculine nor feminine, but human.
As Vance Thompson has said, the lioness is a lion all but a
little of the time, and so Mamise put off sexlessness with her
overalls and put it on with her petticoats. She put off the
coarseness at the same time as she scrubbed away the grime.</p>
<p>The shipyard was still a realm of faery to her. It was an unending
experience of miracles, commonplace to the men, but
wonder-work to her. She had not known what &ldquo;pneumatic&rdquo;
or &ldquo;hydraulic&rdquo; really meant. The acetylene flame-knife, the
incomprehensible ability of levers to give out so much more
power than was put in them, dazed her. Nothing in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Grimms&rsquo; stories could parallel the benevolent ogres of air
and water and their dumfounding transformations.</p>
<p>She learned that machinery can be as beautiful as any other
human structure. Fools and art-snobs had said that machinery
is ugly, and some of it is indeed nearly as ugly as
some canvases, verses, and cathedrals. Other small-pates
chattered of how the divine works of nature shamed the
crudities of man. They spoke of the messages of the mountains,
the sublimities of sunsets, and the lessons taught by
the flowerets. These things are impressive, but it ought to be
possible to give them praise without slandering man&rsquo;s creations,
for a God that could make a man that could make a
work of art would have to be a better God than one who
could merely make a work of art himself.</p>
<p>But machinery has its messages, too. It enables the
little cave-dweller to pulverize the mountain; to ship it to
Mohammed in Medina; to pick it up and shoot it at his
enemies.</p>
<p>Mamise, at any rate, was so enraptured by the fine art of
machinery that when she saw a traveling-crane pick up a
mass of steel and go down the track with it to its place,
she thought that no poplar-tree was ever so graceful. And
the rusty hulls of the new ships showing the sky through the
steel lace of their rivetless sides were fairer than the sky.</p>
<p>Surgeons in steel operated on the battered epidermis of the
<i>Mamise</i> and sewed her up again. It was slow work and it
had all the discouraging influence of work done twice for one
result. But the toil went on, and when at last Davidge left
the hospital he was startled by the change in the vessel. As
a father who has left a little girl at home comes back to find
her a grown woman, so he saw an almost finished ship where
he had left a patchwork of iron plates.</p>
<p>It thrilled him to be back at work again. The silence of
the hospital had irked his soul. Here the air was full of the
pneumatic riveter. They called it the gun that would win
the war. The shipyard atmosphere was shattered all day long
as if with machine-gun fire and the riveters were indeed firing
at Germany. Every red-hot rivet was a bullet&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>The cry grew louder for ships. The submarine was cutting
down the world&rsquo;s whole fleet by a third. In February
the Germans sank the <i>Tuscania</i>, loaded with American soldiers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
and 159 of them were lost. Uncle Sam tightened his
lips and added the <i>Tuscania&rsquo;s</i> dead soldiers to the <i>Lusitania&rsquo;s</i>
men and women and children on the invoice against Germany.
He tightened his belt, too, and cut down his food for Europe&rsquo;s
sake. He loosened his purse-strings and poured out gold and
bonds and war-savings stamps, borrowing, lending, and
spending with the desperation of a gambler determined to
break the bank.</p>
<p>While Davidge was still in the hospital the German offensive
broke. It succeeded beyond the scope of the blackest
prophecy. It threw the fear of hell into the stoutest hearts.
All over the country people were putting pins in maps, always
putting them farther back. Everybody talked strategy, and
geography became the most dreadful of topics.</p>
<p>On March 29th Pershing threw what American troops were
abroad into the general stock, gave them to Haig and Foch
to use as they would.</p>
<p>On the same day the mysterious giant cannon of the Germans
sent a shell into Paris, striking a church and killing
seventy-five worshipers. And it was on a Good Friday that
the men of <i>Gott</i> sent this harbinger of good-will.</p>
<p>The Germans began to talk of the end of Great Britain,
the erasure of France, and the reduction of America to her
proper place.</p>
<p>Spring came to the dismal world again with a sardonic
smile. In Washington the flower-duel was renewed between
the Embassy terrace and the Louise Home. The irises made
a drive and the forsythia sent up its barrage. The wistaria
and the magnolia counterattacked. The Senator took off
his wig again to give official sanction to summer and to rub
his bewildered head the better.</p>
<p>The roving breezes fluttered tragic newspapers everywhere&ndash;&ndash;in
the parks, on the streets, on the scaffolds of the buildings,
along the tented lanes, and in the barrack-rooms.</p>
<p>This wind was a love-zephyr as of old. But the world was
frosted with a tremendous fear. What if old England fell?
Empires did fall. Nineveh, Babylon, and before them Ur
and Nippur, and, after, Persia and Alexander&rsquo;s Greece and
Rome. Germany was making the great try to renew Rome&rsquo;s
sway; her Emperor called himself the C&aelig;sar. What if he
should succeed?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></div>
<p>Distraught by so many successes, the Germans grew frantic.
They were diverted from one prize to another.</p>
<p>The British set their backs to the wall. The French repeated
their Verdun watchword, &ldquo;No thoroughfare,&rdquo; and the
Americans began to come up. The Allies were driven finally
to what they had always realized to be necessary, but had
never consented to&ndash;&ndash;a unified command. They put all their
destinies into the hands of Foch.</p>
<p>Instantly and melodramatically the omens changed. Foch
could live up to his own motto now, &ldquo;Attack, attack, attack.&rdquo;
He had been like a man gambling his last francs. Now he
had word that unlimited funds were on the way from his
Uncle Sam. He did not have to count his money over and
over. He could squander it regardless.</p>
<p>In every direction he attacked, attacked, attacked. The
stupefied world saw the German hordes checked, driven rearward,
here, there, the other place.</p>
<p>Towns were redeemed, rivers regained, prisoners scooped
up by the ten thousand. The pins began a great forward
march along the maps. People fought for the privilege of
placing them. Geography became the most fascinating sport
ever known.</p>
<p>Davidge had come from the hospital minus one arm just as
the bulletins changed from grave to gay. He was afraid now
that the war would be over before his ships could share the
glorious part that ships played in all this victory. The
British had turned all their hulls to the American shores and
the American troops were pouring into them in unbelievable
floods.</p>
<p>Secrecy lost its military value. The best strategy that
could be devised was to publish just how many Americans
were landing in France.</p>
<p>General March would carry the news to Secretary Baker
and he would scatter it broadcast through George Creel&rsquo;s
Committee on Public Information, using telegraph, wireless,
telephone, cable, post-office, placard, courier.</p>
<p>Davidge had always said that the war would be over
as soon as the Germans got the first real jolt. With them war
was a business and they would withdraw from it the moment
they foresaw a certain bankruptcy ahead.</p>
<p>But there was the war after the war to be considered&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
war for commerce, the postponed war with disgruntled labor
and the impatient varieties of socialists and with the rabid
Bolshevists frankly proclaiming their intention to destroy
civilization as it stood.</p>
<p>Like a prudent skipper, Davidge began to trim his ship for
the new storm that must follow the old. He took thought
of the rivalries that would spring up inevitably between the
late Allies, like brothers now, but doomed to turn upon one
another with all the greater bitterness after war. For peace
hath her wickedness no less renowned than war.</p>
<p>What would labor do when the spell of consecration to the
war was gone and the pride of war wages must go before a
fall? The time would come abruptly when the spectacle
of employers begging men to work at any price would be
changed to the spectacle of employers having no work for
men&ndash;&ndash;at any price.</p>
<p>The laborers would not surrender without a battle. They
had tasted power and big money and they would not be lulled
by economic explanations.</p>
<p>Mamise came upon Davidge one day in earnest converse
with a faithful old toiler who had foreseen the same situation
and wanted to know what his boss thought about it.</p>
<p>Iddings had worked as a mechanic all his life. He had
worked hard, had lived sober, had turned his wages over to
his wife, and spent them on his home and his children.</p>
<p>He was as good a man as could be found. Latterly he had
been tormented by two things, the bitterness of increasing
infirmities and dwindling power and the visions held out to
him by Jake Nuddle and the disciples Jake had formed before
he was taken away.</p>
<p>As Mamise came up in her overalls Iddings was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t right, boss, and you know it. When a man like
me works as hard as I done and cuts out all the fun and the
booze and then sees old age comin&rsquo; on and nothin&rsquo; saved to
speak of and no chance to save more&rsquo;n a few hundred dollars,
whilst other men has millions&ndash;&ndash;why, I&rsquo;m readin&rsquo; the other
day of a woman spendin&rsquo; eighty thousand dollars on a fur
coat, and my old woman slavin&rsquo; like a horse all her life and
goin&rsquo; round in a plush rag&ndash;&ndash;I tell you it ain&rsquo;t right and you
can&rsquo;t prove it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to try to,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t build
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
the world and I can&rsquo;t change it much. I see nothing but
injustice everywhere I look. It&rsquo;s not only among men, but
among animals and insects and plants. The weeds choke out
the flowers; the wolves eat up the sheep unless the dogs fight
the wolves; the gentle and the kind go under unless they&rsquo;re
mighty clever. They call it the survival of the fittest, but
it&rsquo;s really the survival of the fightingest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo; to believe,&rdquo; said Iddings. &ldquo;The
workman will never get his rights unless he fights for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he wants to get rich he&rsquo;s got to fight the rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He wants to make sure he&rsquo;s fighting his real enemies
and fighting with weapons that won&rsquo;t be boomerangs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get that last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Iddings, there are a lot of damned fools filling
workmen&rsquo;s heads with insanity, telling them that their one
hope of happiness is to drag down the rich, to blow up the
factories or take control of &rsquo;em, to bankrupt the bankers and
turn the government upside down. If they can&rsquo;t get a
majority at the polls they won&rsquo;t pay any attention to the
polls or the laws. They&rsquo;ll butcher the police and assassinate
the big men. But that game can&rsquo;t win. It&rsquo;s been tried again
and again by discontented idiots who go out and kill instead
of going out to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get rich by robbing the rich and dividing up
their money. If you took all that Rockefeller is said to have
and divided it up among the citizens of the country you&rsquo;d
get four or five dollars apiece at most, and you&rsquo;d soon lose
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rockefeller started as a laboring-man at wages you
wouldn&rsquo;t look at to-day. The laboring-men alongside could
have made just as much as he did if they&rsquo;d a mind to. Somebody
said he could have written Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays if he
had a mind to, and Lamb said, &lsquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;d a mind to.&rsquo;
The thing seems to be to be born with a mind to and to
cultivate a mind to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take Rockefeller&rsquo;s money away and he&rsquo;ll make more
while you&rsquo;re fumbling with what you&rsquo;ve got. Take Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays away and he&rsquo;ll write others while you&rsquo;re scratching
your head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em fool you, Iddings, into believing that rich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
men get rich by stealing. We all cheat more or less, but no
man ever built up a big fortune by plain theft. Men make
money by making it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karl Marx, who wrote your &lsquo;Workmen&rsquo;s Bible,&rsquo; called
capital a vampire. Well, there aren&rsquo;t any vampires except
in the movies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of vamping wealth, did you ever hear how I
got where I am?&ndash;&ndash;not that it&rsquo;s so very far and not that I
like to talk about myself&ndash;&ndash;but just to show you how true
your man Marx is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a working-man and worked hard. I put by a little
out of what I made. Of nights I studied. I learned all ends
of the ship-building business in a way. But I needed money
to get free. It never occurred to me to claim somebody else&rsquo;s
money as mine. I thought the rich would help me to get rich
if I helped them to get richer. My idea of getting capital was
to go get it. I was a long time finding where there was any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by I heard of an old wreck on the coast&ndash;&ndash;a steamer
had run aground and the hull was abandoned after they took
out what machinery they could salvage. The hull stood up
in the storms and the sand began to bury it. It would have
been &lsquo;dead capital&rsquo; then for sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The timbers were sound, though, and I found I could
buy it cheap. I put in all I had saved in all my life, eight
thousand dollars, for the hull. I got a man to risk something
with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We took the hull off the ground, refitted it, stepped in
six masts, and made a big schooner of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She cost us sixty thousand dollars all told. Before she
was ready to sail we sold her for a hundred and twenty
thousand. The buyers made big money out of her. The
schooner is carrying food now and giving employment to
sailors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who got robbed on that transaction? Where did &lsquo;dead
labor suck the life out of living labor,&rsquo; as Karl Marx says?
You could do the same. You could if you would. There&rsquo;s
plenty of old hulls lying around on the sands of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iddings had nothing in him to respond to the poetry of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;but where would I
get my start? I got no eight thousand or anybody to lend
me ten dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The banks will lend to men who will make money make
money. It&rsquo;s not the guarantee they want so much as inspiration.
Pierpont Morgan said he lent on character, not on
collateral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morgan, humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble isn&rsquo;t with Morgan, but with you. What
do you do with your nights? Study? study? beat your
brains for ideas? No, you go home, tired, play with the
children, talk with the wife, smoke, go to bed. It&rsquo;s a beautiful
life, but it&rsquo;s not a money-making life. You can&rsquo;t make
money by working eight hours a day for another man&rsquo;s money.
You&rsquo;ve got to get out and find it or dig it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That business with the old hull put me on my feet, put
dreams in my head. I looked about for other chances, took
some of them and wished I hadn&rsquo;t. But I kept on trying.
The war in Europe came. The world was crazy for ships.
They couldn&rsquo;t build &rsquo;em fast enough to keep ahead of the
submarines. On the Great Lakes there was a big steamer
not doing much work. I heard of her. I went up and saw
her. The job was to get her to the ocean. I managed it on
borrowed money, bought her, and brought her up the Saint
Lawrence to the sea&ndash;&ndash;and down to New York. I made a
fortune on that deal. Then did I retire and smoke my pipe
of peace? No. I looked for another chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When our country went into the war she needed ships
of her own. She had to have shipyards first to build &rsquo;em in.
My lifelong ambition was to make ships from the keel-plate
up. I looked for the best place to put a shipyard,
picked on this spot because other people hadn&rsquo;t found it.
My partners and I got the land cheap because it was swamp.
We worked out our plans, sitting up all night over blue-prints
and studying how to save every possible penny and
every possible waste motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now look at the swamp. It&rsquo;s one of the prettiest
yards in the world. The Germans sank my <i>Clara</i>. Did I
stop or go to making speeches about German vampires?
No. I went on building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Germans tried to get my next boat. I fought for
her as I&rsquo;ll fight the Germans, the I. W. W., the Bolshevists,
or any other sneaking coyotes that try to destroy my
property.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I lost this right arm trying to save that ship. And
now that I&rsquo;m crippled, am I asking for a pension or an admission
to an old folks&rsquo; home? Am I passing the hat to you
other workers? No. I&rsquo;m as good as ever I was. I made
my left arm learn my right arm&rsquo;s business. If I lose my left
arm next I&rsquo;ll teach my feet to write. And if I lose those,
by God! I&rsquo;ll write with my teeth, or wigwag my ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with you, Iddings, and the like of you is
you brood over your troubles, instead of brooding over ways
to improve yourself. You spend time and money on quack
doctors. But I tell you, don&rsquo;t fight your work or your boss.
Fight nature, fight sleep, fight fatigue, fight the sky, fight
despair, and if you want money hunt up a place where it&rsquo;s
to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Iddings had had brains enough to understand all this
he would not have been Iddings working by the day. His
stubborn response was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll say the laboring-man is being bled by the
capitalists and he&rsquo;ll never get his rights till he grabs &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll say be sure that you&rsquo;re grabbing your rights
and not grabbing your own throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for all the liberty in the world, for the dignity of
labor, the voice of labor, the labor-union, the profit-sharing
basis, the republic of labor. I think the workers ought to
have a voice in running the work&ndash;&ndash;all the share they can
handle, all the control that won&rsquo;t hurt the business. But
the business has got to come first, for it&rsquo;s business that makes
comfort. I&rsquo;ll let any man run this shop who can run it as
well as I can or better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m against is letting somebody run my business
who can&rsquo;t run his own. Talk won&rsquo;t build ships, old man.
And complaints and protests won&rsquo;t build ships, or make any
important money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor men are just as good as rich men and ought to have
just the same rights, votes, privileges. But the first right a
poor man ought to preserve is the right to become a rich man.
Riches are beautiful things, Iddings, and they&rsquo;re worth
working for. And they&rsquo;ve got to be worked for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A laboring-man is a man that labors, whether he labors
for two dollars a day or a thousand; and a loafer is a loafer,
whether he has millions or dimes. Well, I&rsquo;ve talked longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
than I ever did before or ever will again. Do you believe
anything I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge had to laugh. &ldquo;Well, Iddings, I&rsquo;ve got to hand
it to you for obstinacy; you&rsquo;ve got an old mule skinned to
death. But old mules can&rsquo;t compete with race-horses.
Balking and kicking won&rsquo;t get you very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked away, and Mamise went along. Davidge was
in a somber mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old fellow, he&rsquo;s got no self-starter, no genius, no
ideas, and he&rsquo;s doomed to be a drudge. It&rsquo;s the rotten cruelty
of the world that most people are born without enough get-up-and-get
to bring them and their work together without a
whistle and a time-clock and an overseer. What scheme could
ever be invented to keep poor old Iddings up to the level of
a Sutton or a Sutton down to his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mamise had heard a vast amount of discontented talk among
the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an awful lot of trouble brewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is no luxury to me,&rdquo; said Davidge. &ldquo;Blessed
is he that expects trouble, for he shall get it. Wait till this
war is over and then you&rsquo;ll see a real war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we all get killed or starved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. But in the mean while we had better sail on
and on and on. The storm will find us wherever we are,
and there&rsquo;s more danger close ashore than out at sea. Let&rsquo;s
make a tour of the <i>Mamise</i> and see how soon she&rsquo;ll be ready
to go overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Nicky Easton&rsquo;s attempt to assassinate the ship had
failed, but the wounds he dealt her had retarded her so
that she missed by many weeks the chance of being launched
on the Fourth of July with the other ships that made the
Big Splash on that holy day. The first boat took her dive
at one minute after midnight and eighty-one ships followed
her into the astonished sea.</p>
<p>While the damaged parts of the <i>Mamise</i> were remade,
Davidge pushed the work on other portions of the ship&rsquo;s
anatomy, so that when at length she was ready for the dip
she was farther advanced than steel ships usually are before
they are first let into the sea.</p>
<p>Her upper works were well along, her funnel was in, and
her mast and bridge. She looked from a distance like a ship
that had run ashore.</p>
<p>There was keen rivalry among the building-crews of the
ships that grew alongside the <i>Mamise</i>, and each gang strove
to put its boat overboard in record time. The &ldquo;Mamisers,&rdquo;
as they called themselves, fought against time and trouble
to redeem her from the &ldquo;jinx&rdquo; that had set her back again
and again. During the last few days the heat was furious
and the hot plates made an inferno of the work. Then an
icy rain set in. The workers would not stop for mean weather,
hot or cold.</p>
<p>Mamise, the rivet-passer, stood to her task in a continual
shower-bath. The furnace was sheltered, but the hot rivets
must be passed across the rain curtain. Sutton urged her to
lay off and give way to Snotty or somebody whose health
didn&rsquo;t matter a damn. Davidge ordered her home, but her
pride in her sex and her zest for her ship kept her at work.</p>
<p>And then suddenly she sneezed!</p>
<p>She sneezed again and again helplessly, and she was stricken
with a great fear. For in that day a sneeze was not merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
the little explosion of tickled surfaces or a forewarning of a
slight cold. It was the alarum of the new Great Death, the
ravening lion under the sheep&rsquo;s wool of influenza.</p>
<p>The world that had seen the ancient horror of famine come
stalking back from the Dark Ages trembled now before the
plague. The influenza swept the world with recurrent
violences.</p>
<p>Men who had feared to go to the trenches were snatched
from their offices and from their homes. Men who had tried
in vain to get into the fight died in their beds. Women
and children perished innumerably. Hearse-horses were overworked.
The mysterious, invisible all-enemy did not spare
the soldiers; it sought them in the dugouts, among the
reserves, at the ports of embarkation and debarkation, at the
training-camps. In the hospitals it slew the convalescent
wounded and killed the nurses.</p>
<p>From America the influenza took more lives than the war
itself.</p>
<p>It baffled science and carried off the doctors. Masks appeared
and people in offices were dressed in gauze muzzles.
In some of the cities the entire populace went with bandaged
mouths, and a man who would steal a furtive puff of a cigarette
stole up a quiet street and kept his eyes alert for the
police.</p>
<p>Whole families were stricken down and brave women who
dared the pestilence found homes where father, mother, and
children lay writhing and starving in pain and delirium.</p>
<p>At the shipyard every precaution was taken, and Davidge
fought the unseen hosts for his men and for their families.
Mamise had worn herself down gadding the workmen&rsquo;s row
with medicines and victuals in her basket. And yet the
death-roll mounted and strength was no protection.</p>
<p>In Washington and other cities the most desperate experiments
in sanitation were attempted. Offices were closed or
dismissed early. Stenographers took dictation in masks. It
was forbidden to crowd the street-cars. All places of public
assembly were closed, churches no less than theaters and
moving-picture shows. It was as illegal to hold prayer-meetings
as dances.</p>
<p>This was the supreme blow at religion. The preachers
who had confessed that the Church had failed to meet the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
war problems were dazed. Mankind had not recovered from
the fact that the world had been made a hell by the German
Emperor, who was the most pious of rulers and claimed to
take his crown from God direct. The German Protestants
and priests had used their pulpits for the propaganda of hate.
The Catholic Emperor of Austria had aligned his priests.
Catholic and Protestants fought for the Allies in the trenches,
unfrocked or in their pulpits. The Bishop of London was
booed as a slacker. The Pope wrung his hands and could
not decide which way to turn. One British general frivolously
put it, &ldquo;I am afraid that the dear old Church has missed the
bus this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All religions were split apart and, as Lincoln said of the
Civil War, both sides sent up their prayers to the same
God, demanding that He crush the enemy.</p>
<p>For all the good the Y. M. C. A. accomplished, it ended
the war with the contempt of most of the soldiers. Individual
clergymen won love and crosses of war, but as men, not as
saints.</p>
<p>The abandoned world abandoned all its gods, and men
fought men in the name of mankind.</p>
<p>Even against the plague the churchfolk were refused permission
to pray together. Christian Scientists published full
pages of advertising protesting against the horrid situation,
but nobody heeded.</p>
<p>The ship of state lurched along through the mingled storms,
mastless, rudderless, pilotless, priestless, and everybody
wondered which would live the longer, the ship or the storm.</p>
<p>And then Mamise sneezed. And the tiny at-choo! frightened
her to the soul of her soul. It frightened the riveting-crew
as well. The plague had come among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop them tongs and go home!&rdquo; said Sutton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to help finish my ship,&rdquo; Mamise pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s to be launched day after to-morrow and I&rsquo;ve
got to christen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home or I&rsquo;ll carry you,&rdquo; said Sutton, and he advanced
on her. She dropped her tongs and ran through
the gusty rain, across the yard, out of the gate, and down
the muddy paths as if a wolf pursued.</p>
<p>She flung into her cottage, lighted the fires, heated water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
drank a quart of it, took quinine, and crept into her bed.
Her tremors shook the covers off. Sweat rained out of her
pores and turned to ice-water with the following ague.</p>
<p>The doctor came. Sutton had gone for him and threatened
to beat him up if he delayed. The doctor had nothing to
give her but orders to stay in bed and wait. Davidge came,
and Abbie, and they tried to pretend that they were not in
a worse panic than Mamise.</p>
<p>There were no nurses to be spared and Abbie was installed.
In spite of her malministrations or because of them, Mamise
grew better. She stayed in bed all that day and the next,
and when the morning of the launching dawned, she felt so
well that Abbie could not prevent her from getting up and
putting on her clothes.</p>
<p>She was to be woman again to-day and to wear the most
fashionable gown in her wardrobe and the least masculine hat.</p>
<p>She felt a trifle giddy as she dressed, but she told Abbie
that she never felt better. Her only alarm was the difficulty
in hooking her frock at the waist. Abbie fought them
together with all her might and main.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If being a workman is going to take away my waistline,
here&rsquo;s where I quit work,&rdquo; said Mamise. &ldquo;As Mr.
Dooley says, I&rsquo;m a pathrite, but I&rsquo;m no bigot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge had told her to keep to her room. He had telephoned
to Polly Widdicombe to come down and christen the
ship. Polly was delayed and Davidge was frantic. In fact,
the Widdicombe motor ran off the road into a slough of despond,
and Polly did not arrive until after the ship was launched
from the ways and the foolhardy Mamise was in the
hospital.</p>
<p>When Davidge saw Mamise climbing the steps to the launching-platform
he did not recognize her under her big hat till
she paused for breath and looked up, counting the remaining
steep steps and wondering if her tottering legs would negotiate
the height.</p>
<p>He ran down and haled her up, scolding her with fury.
He had been on the go all night, and he was raw with uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Mamise pleaded. &ldquo;I got caught in the
jam at the gate and was nearly crushed. That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s
glorious up here and I&rsquo;d rather die than miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>It was a sight to see. The shipyard was massed with workmen
and their families, and every roof was crowded. On
a higher platform in the rear the reporters of the moving-picture
newspapers were waiting with their cameras. On
the roof of a low shed a military band was tootling
merrily.</p>
<p>And the sky had relented of its rain. The day was a
masterpiece of good weather. A brilliant throng mounted
to the platform, an admiral, sea-captains and lieutenants,
officers of the army, a Senator, Congressmen, judges, capitalists,
the jubilant officers of the ship-building corporation.
And Mamise was the queen of the day. She was the &ldquo;sponsor&rdquo;
for the ship and her name stood out on both sides of the
prow, high overhead where the launching-crew grinned down
on her and called her by her <i>nom de guerre</i>, &ldquo;Moll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moving-picture men yelled at her and asked her to
pose. She went to the rail and tried to smile, feeling as
silly as a Sunday-school girl repeating a golden text, and
looking it.</p>
<p>Once more she would appear in the Sunday supplements,
and her childish confusion would make throngs in moving-picture
theaters laugh with pleasant amusement. Mamise
was news to-day.</p>
<p>The air was full of the hubbub of preparation. Underneath
the upreared belly of the ship gnomes crouched,
pounding the wedges in to lift the hull so that other gnomes
could knock the shoring out.</p>
<p>There was a strange fascination in the racket of the shores
falling over, the dull clatter of a vast bowling-alley after a
ten-strike.</p>
<p>Painters were at work brushing over the spots where the
shores had rested.</p>
<p>Down in the tanks inside the hull were a few luckless
anonymities with search-lights, put there to watch for leaks
from loose rivet-heads. They would be in the dark and see
nothing of the festival. Always there has to be some one in
the dark at such a time.</p>
<p>The men who would saw the holding-blocks stood ready, as
solemn as clergymen. The cross-saws were at hand for their
sacred office. The sawyers and the other workmen were
overdoing their unconcern. Mamise caught sight of Sutton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
lounging in violent indifference, but giving himself away by
the frenzy of his jaws worrying his quid and spurting tobacco
juice in all directions.</p>
<p>There was reason, too, for uneasiness. Sometimes a ship
would not start when the blocks were sawed through. There
would be a long delay while hydraulic jacks were sought and
put to work to force her forward. Such a delay had a superstitious
meaning. Nobody liked a ship that was afraid of her
element. They wanted an eagerness in her get-away. Or
suppose she shot out too impetuously and listed on the
ways, ripping the scaffolding to pieces like a whale thrashing
a raft apart. Suppose she careened and stuck or rolled over
in the mud. Such things had happened and might happen
again. The <i>Mamise</i> had suffered so many mishaps that the
other ship crews called her a hoodoo.</p>
<p>At last the hour drew close. Davidge was a fanatic on
schedules. He did not want his ship to be late to her engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s named after me, poor thing,&rdquo; said Mamise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
bound to be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be on time for once,&rdquo; Davidge growled.</p>
<p>In the older days with the old-fashioned ships the boats
had gone to the sea like brides with trousseaux complete.
The launching-guests had made the journey with her; a
dinner had been served aboard, and when the festivities were
ended the waiting tugs had taken the new ship to the old
sea for the honeymoon.</p>
<p>But nowadays only hulls were launched, as a rule. The
mere husk was then brought to the equipping-dock to receive
her engines and all her equipment.</p>
<p>The <i>Mamise</i> was farther advanced, but she would have
to tie up for sixty days at least. The carpenters had her
furniture all ready and waiting, but she could not put forth
under her own steam for two months more.</p>
<p>The more reason for impatience at any further delay.
Davidge went along the launching-platform rails, like a
captain on the bridge, eager to move out of the slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make ready!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Stand by! Where&rsquo;s
the bottle? Good Lord! Where&rsquo;s the bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That precious quart of champagne was missing now. The
bottle had been prepared by an eminent jeweler with silver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
decoration and a silken net. The neck would be a cherished
souvenir thereafter, made into a vase to hold flowers.</p>
<p>The bottle was found, a cable was lowered from aloft and
the bottle fastened to it.</p>
<p>Davidge explained to Mamise for the tenth time just what
she was to do. He gave the signal to the sawyers. The
snarl of the teeth in the holding-blocks was lost in the noise
of the band. The great whistle on the fabricating-plant
split the air. The moving-picture camera-men cranked
their machines. The last inches of the timbers that held
the ship ashore were gnawed through. The sawyers said
they could feel the ship straining. She wanted to get to her
sea. They loved her for it.</p>
<p>Suddenly she was &ldquo;sawed off.&rdquo; She was moving. The
rigid mountain was an avalanche of steel departing down a
wooden hill.</p>
<p>Mamise stared, gasped, paralyzed with launch-fright.
Davidge nudged her. She hurled the bottle at the vanishing
keel. It broke with a loud report. The wine splashed
everywhichway. Some of it spattered Mamise&rsquo;s new gown.</p>
<p>Her muscles went to work in womanly fashion to brush
off the stain.</p>
<p>When she looked up, ashamed of her homely misbehavior,
she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord! I forgot to say, &lsquo;I christen thee <i>Mamise</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it now,&rdquo; said Davidge.</p>
<p>She shouted the words down the channel opening like an
abyss as the vast hulk diminished toward the river. Far
below she could see the water leap back from the shock of the
new-comer. Great, circling ripples retreated outward. Waves
fought and threw up bouquets of spume.</p>
<p>The chute smoked with the heat of the ship&rsquo;s passage
and a white cloud of steam flew up and followed her into the
river.</p>
<p>She was launched, beautifully, perfectly. She sailed level.
She was water-borne.</p>
<p>People were cheering, the band was pounding all out of
time, every eye following the ship, the leader forgetting to lead.</p>
<p>Mamise wept and Davidge&rsquo;s eyes were wet. Something
surged in him like the throe of the river where the ship went
in. It was good to have built a good ship.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>Mamise wrung his hand. She would have kissed him,
but she remembered in time. The camera caught the impulse.
People laughed at that in the movie theaters. People
cheered in distant cities as they assisted weeks after in the
d&eacute;but of <i>Mamise</i>.</p>
<p>The movies took the people everywhere on magic carpets.
Yet there were curious people who bewailed them as inartistic!</p>
<p>Mamise&rsquo;s little body and her little soul were almost blasted
by the enormity of her emotions. The ship was like a child
too big for its mother, and the ending of the long travail left
her wrecked.</p>
<p>She tried to enter into the hilarity of the guests, but she
was filled with awe and prostrate as if a god had passed by.</p>
<p>The crowd began to trickle down the long steps to the
feast in the mess hall. She dreaded the descent, the long
walk, the sitting at table. She wanted to go home and cry
very hard and be good and sick for a long while.</p>
<p>But she could not desert Davidge at such a time or mar his
triumph by her hypochondria. She wavered as she climbed
down. She rode with Davidge to the mess-hall in his car
and forced herself to voice congratulations too solemn and
too fervid for words.</p>
<p>The guests of honor sat at a table disguised with scenery
as a ship&rsquo;s deck. A thousand people sat at the other tables
and took part in the banquet.</p>
<p>Mamise could not eat the food of human caterers. She
had fed on honey-dew and drunk the milk of paradise.</p>
<p>She lived through the long procession of dishes and heard
some of the oratory, the glowing praises of Davidge and
Uncle Sam, Mr. Schwab, Mr. Hurley, President Wilson,
the Allies, and everybody else. She heard it proclaimed that
America was going back to the sea, so long neglected. The
prodigal was returning home.</p>
<p>Mamise could think of nothing but a wish to be in bed.
The room began to blur. People&rsquo;s faces went out of focus.
Her teeth began to chatter. Her jaw worked ridiculously
like a riveting-gun. She was furious at it.</p>
<p>She heard Davidge whispering: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter,
honey? You&rsquo;re ill again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I fancy&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I guess I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;am,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God!&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;why did you come out?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p>He rose, lifted her elbow, murmured something to the
guests. He would have supported her to the door, but she
pleaded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! They&rsquo;ll think it&rsquo;s too much ch-ch-champagne.
I&rsquo;m all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made the door in excellent control, but it cost her her
last cent of strength. Outside, she would have fallen, but
he huddled her in his arms, lifted her, carried her to his car.
He piled robes on her, but those riveters inside her threatened
to pound her to death. Burning pains gnawed her chest like
cross-cut saws.</p>
<p>When the car stopped she was not in front of her cottage,
but before the hospital.</p>
<p>When the doctor finished his inspection she heard him
mumble to Davidge:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pneumonia! Double pneumonia!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Once more Mamise had come between Davidge and his
work. He did not care what happened to his ships or
his shipyard. He watched Mamise fighting for life, if indeed
she fought, for he could not get to her through the fog.</p>
<p>She was often delirious and imagined herself back in her
cruel times. He learned a few things about that mystic period
she would never disclose. And he was glad that she had
never told him more. He fled from her, for eavesdropping
on a delirium has something of the contemptible quality of
peeping at a nakedness.</p>
<p>He supposed that Mamise would die. All the poor women
with pasts that he had read about, in what few novels he had
read, had died or it had been found out that they had magically
retained their innocence through years of evil environment.</p>
<p>He supposed also that Mamise would die, because that was
the one thing needful to make his life a perfect failure. He
had not gone to war, yet he had lost his arm. He had never
really desperately loved before, and now he would lose his
heart. It was just as well, because if Mamise lived he would
lose her, anyway. He would not tie her to the crippled
thing he was.</p>
<p>While the battalions of disease ravaged the poor Belgium
of Mamise&rsquo;s body the world outside went on making history.
The German Empire kept caving in on all sides. Her armies
held nowhere. Her only pride was in saving a defeat from
being a disaster. Her confederates were disintegrating. The
newspapers mentioned now, not cities that surrendered to the
Allies, but nations.</p>
<p>And at last Germany added one more to her unforgivable
assaults upon the patience of mankind. Just as the Allies
poised for the last tremendous all-satisfying <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i>
the Empire put up her hands and whined the word that had
become the world-wide synonym for poltroonery, &ldquo;<i>Kamerad!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>Foch wept, American soldiers cursed because they could
not prove their mettle and drive the boche into the Rhine.
Never was so bitter a disappointment mingled with a triumph
so magnificent. The world went wild with the news of
peace. The nations all made carnival over the premature
rumor and would not be denied their rhapsodies because the
story was denied. They made another and a wilder carnival
when the news was confirmed.</p>
<p>Davidge took the peace without enthusiasm. Mamise had
been better, but was worse again. She got still better than
before and not quite so worse again. And so in a climbing
zigzag she mounted to health at last.</p>
<p>She had missed the carnival and she woke on the morning
after. Nearly everybody was surprised to find that ending
this one war had brought a dozen new wars, a hundred, a
myriad.</p>
<p>The danger that had united the nations into a holy crusade
had ended, and the crusaders were men again. They were
back in the same old world with the same old sins and sorrows
and selfishnesses, and unnumbered new ones. And they
had the habit of battle&ndash;&ndash;the gentlest were accustomed to
slaughter.</p>
<p>It was not the Central Powers alone that had disintegrated.
The Entente Cordiale was turned into a caldron of toil and
trouble. No two people in any one nation agreed on the
best way to keep the peace. Nobody could accept any
other body&rsquo;s theories.</p>
<p>Russia, whose collapse had cost the Allies a glimpse of
destruction and a million lives, was a new plague spot, the
center of the world&rsquo;s dread. While the people in Russia
starved or slew one another their terrible missionaries went
about the world preaching chaos as the new gospel and
fanning the always smoldering discontent of labor into a
prairie fire.</p>
<p>Ships were needed still. Europe must be fed. Hunger was
the Bolshevists&rsquo; blood-brother. Unemployment was the third
in the grim fraternity.</p>
<p>Davidge increased his force daily, adding a hundred men or
more to his army, choosing mainly from the returning hordes
of soldiers.</p>
<p>When Mamise at last had left the hospital she found a new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
ship growing where the <i>Mamise</i> had dwelt. The <i>Mamise</i>
was at the equipping-dock, all but ready for the sea, about
to steam out and take on a cargo of food to Poland, the new-old
country gathering her three selves together under the
spell of Paderewski&rsquo;s patriotic fire.</p>
<p>Mamise wanted to go to work again. Her strength was
back and she was not content to return to crochet-hooks and
tennis-racquets. She had tasted the joy of machinery, had
seen it add to her light muscles a giant&rsquo;s strength. She wanted
to build a ship all by herself, especially the riveting.</p>
<p>Davidge opposed her with all his might. He pointed out
that the dream of women laboring with men, each at her job,
had been postponed, like so many other dreams, lost like so
many other benefits that mitigated war.</p>
<p>The horrors of peace were upon the world. Men were
driving the women back to the kitchen. There were not
jobs enough for all.</p>
<p>But Mamise pleaded to be allowed to work at least till her
own ship was finished. So Davidge yielded to quiet her.
She put back into her overalls and wielded a monkey-wrench
in the engine-room. She took flying trips on the lofty cranes.</p>
<p>One afternoon when the whistle blew she remained aloft
alone to revel in the wonder view of the world, the wide and
gleaming river, the peaceful hills, the so-called handiwork of
God, and everywhere the pitiful beauty of man&rsquo;s efforts to
work out his destiny and enslave the forces.</p>
<p>Human power was not the least of these forces. Ingenious
men had learned how to use not only wind currents, waterfalls,
and lightning and the heat stored up in coal, but to use
also the power stored up in the muscles of their more slow-brained
fellows. And these forces broke loose at times with
the ruinous effect of tornadoes, floods, and thunderbolts.</p>
<p>The laborers needed merciful and intelligent handling, and
the better they were the better their work. It was hard to
say what was heresy and what was wisdom, what was oppression
and what was helpful discipline. Whichever way
one turned, there was misunderstanding, protest, revolt.</p>
<p>Mamise thought that everybody ought to be happy and love
everybody else. She thought that it ought to be joy enough
to go on working in that splendid shop and about the flock of
ships on the ways.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></div>
<p>And yet people would insist on being miserable. She, the
priestess of unalloyed rapture, also sighed.</p>
<p>Hearing a step on the crane, she was startled. After all,
she was only a woman, alone up here, and help could never
reach her if any one threatened her. She looked over the edge.</p>
<p>There came the man who most of all threatened her&ndash;&ndash;Davidge.
He endangered her future most of all, whether he
married her or deserted her. He evidently had no intention
of marrying her, for she had given him chances enough and
hints enough.</p>
<p>He had a telegram in his hand and apologized for following
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know but it might be bad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody to send me bad news except you and
Abbie.&rdquo; She opened the telegram. It was an invitation from
Polly to come back to sanity and a big dance at the Hotel
Washington. She smiled. &ldquo;I wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever dance
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davidge was tired from the climb. He dropped to the seat
occupied by the chauffeur of the crane. He rose at once with
an apology and offered his place to Mamise.</p>
<p>She shook her head, then gave a start:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heavens! that reminds me! That seat of yours I
took on the train from New York. I&rsquo;ve never paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pay it. That&rsquo;s where all the trouble started.
How much was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two dollars now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly one then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drove her hand down into the pocket of her breeches
and dragged up a fistful of small money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day was pay-day. Here&rsquo;s your dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a receipt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Mike. I couldn&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An odd look crossed his face. He did not play easily, but
he tried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you a receipt now, because everybody is
looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you had an idea of kissing me?&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reckless devil! Do you think that a plutocrat can
kiss every poor goil in the shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, do you think you&rsquo;ll take advantage of my
womanly helplessness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Overalls is royal raiment when wore for voitue&rsquo;s
sake. You&rsquo;ll never kiss me till you put a wedding-ring on
me finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked away, sobered and troubled.</p>
<p>She stared at him. &ldquo;Good Heavens! Can&rsquo;t you take a
hint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I insist on your marrying me. You have compromised
me hopelessly. Everybody says I am working here
just to be near you, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a caricature of mental and physical awkwardness.</p>
<p>She gasped: &ldquo;And still he doesn&rsquo;t answer me! Must I
get on my knees to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped on her knees, a blue denim angel on a cloud,
praying higher.</p>
<p>He stormed: &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, get up! Somebody will
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not budge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not rise from my knees till you
promise to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started to escape, moved toward the steps. She seized
his knees and moaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pity me! pity me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was excruciated with her burlesque, tried to drag her to
her feet, but he had only one hand and he could not manage
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please get up. I can&rsquo;t make you. I&rsquo;ve only one arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if it fits.&rdquo; She rose and, holding his helpless
hand, whirled round into his arm. &ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; Then she stood
there and called from her eyrie to the sea-gulls that haunted
the river, &ldquo;In the presence of witnesses this man has taken
me for his affianced fianc&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had a wedding in the village church. Abbie was
matron of honor and gave her sister away. Her children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
were very dressed up and highly uncomfortable. Abbie drew
Mamise aside after the signing of the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank Gawd you&rsquo;re marrit at last, Mamise! You&rsquo;ve
been such a worrit to me. I hope you&rsquo;ll be as happy as poor
Jake and me was. If he only hadn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; had to gave his life
for you, you wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; been. But he&rsquo;s watchin&rsquo; you from
up there and&ndash;&ndash; Oh dear! Oh dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake was already a tradition of increasing beauty. So
may we all of us be!</p>
<p>Mamise insisted on dragging Davidge away from the shipyard
for a brief honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a great executive, they&rsquo;ll never miss you.
But I shall. I decline to take my honeymoon or live my
married life alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up to Washington for a while of shopping.
The city was already reverting to type. The heart had gone
out of the stay-at-home war-workers and the tide was on
the ebb save for a new population of returned soldiers, innumerably
marked with the proofs of sacrifice, not only by
their service chevrons, their wound stripes, but also by the
parts of their brave bodies that they had left in France.</p>
<p>They were shy and afraid of themselves and of the world,
and especially of their women. But, as Adelaide wrote of
the new task of rehabilitation, &ldquo;a merciful Providence sees to
it that we become, in time, used to anything. If we had all
been born with one arm or one leg our lives and loves would
have gone on just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To many another woman, as to Mamise, was given the
privilege of adding herself to her wounded lover to complete
him.</p>
<p>Polly Widdicombe, seeing Mamise and Davidge dancing
together, smiled through her tears, almost envying her her
husband. Davidge danced as well with one arm as with
two, but Mamise, as she clasped that blunt shoulder and
that pocketed sleeve, was given the final touch of rapture
made perfect with regret: she had the aching pride of a
soldier&rsquo;s sweetheart, for she could say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am his right arm.&rdquo;</p>
